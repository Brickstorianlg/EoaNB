 secondopiumwar.1.t:0 "The Execution of Father Chapdelaine"
 secondopiumwar.1.d:0 "Our officials in Hong Kong have reported the execution of missionary Auguste Chapdelaine at the hand of the Qing Mandarin of Yaoshan. He was arrested, trialed, and executed under orders of the Chinese officials after his alleged involvement stirring up insurrections and for refusing to pay bribes to officials. After his beheading and execution, local missionaries in Hong Kong spread the news, eventually reaching the ears of officials in the chargé d'affaires in Macao. The animal-like treatment of our missionary will not go unnoticed in the public eye, however, risking a diplomatic engagement with the stubborn Qing government likely won’t end in our favor. Of course, we could always kill two birds with one stone..."
 secondopiumwar.1.a:0 "Demand Reparations from the Chinese!"
 secondopiumwar.1.b:0 "Reach out to the British to form a coalition."

 secondopiumwar.2.t:0 "The French demand Reparations!"
 secondopiumwar.2.d:0 "A letter reached Viceroy Yeh’s office today, claiming to be from a plenipotentiary of [FRA.GetNameDef]. Within it were details of a potential meeting regarding our compensation for the execution of their missionary, Auguste Chapdelaine. Negotiations soon broke down after the viceroy refused any further comment on Chapdelaine’s death. Yeh and the plenipotentiary failed to reach an agreement, eventually leading to both parties leaving with less than nothing done. Talks, however, continued well past the meeting, with Yeh releasing a statement suggesting that Chapdelaine may not have been executed at all, instead a man of similar name found to be in a similar line of work. The French delegation found this offensive, and has threatened to end diplomatic talks if Yeh refuses to release more information and to comply with French demands."
 secondopiumwar.2.a:0 "Reparations are a small matter to get them off our backs."
 secondopiumwar.2.b:0 "Reparations? Never!"
 secondopiumwar.3.t:0 "[QNG.GetNameDef] succumbs!"
 secondopiumwar.3.d:0 "After tedious negotiations with Viceroy Yeh and Qing officials, a letter reached the plenipotentiary’s office stating an approval to cooperate with our demands for further investigation and for compensation. Chinese delegates have already begun work assisting our officials in their investigations, and reparations have been sent to our offices in Macao as requested by our plenipotentiary. A diplomatic victory for France!"
 secondopiumwar.3.a:0 "Great!"
 secondopiumwar.4.t:0 "The Chinese refuse!"
 secondopiumwar.4.d:0 "Viceroy Yeh and his Qing officials have made it clear to our French delegations that no further actions on their part will be taken. Having already denied our demands for further investigation, the delegation also brings news that they have refused to pay compensation of any kind as they believe Chapdelaine had broken Qing law. This message comes as no real surprise, given the stubborn and corrupt government of the Qing dynasty has refused similar demands previously. With the denial of our demands comes a new opportunity, however, an opportunity to side with the Rosbifs in their war against the Qing."
 secondopiumwar.4.a:0 "We must live with that."
 secondopiumwar.4.b:0 "How dare they?! Reach out to the British to form a coalition."

 secondopiumwar.5.t:0 "[FRA.GetNameDef] proposes a Coalition against the Chinese!"
 secondopiumwar.5.d:0 "With the denial of their delegations and demands in China, diplomats from France have begun talks with our own officials in the hopes of a coalition. With France now having its own Casus Belli against the barbarous Chinese, it seems they have finally decided to drop their façade of neutrality. Many in parliament and the populace have advocated for their support of the coalition, but a few outspoken individuals of parliament have also pointed to the possible diplomatic victory if Britain were to win the war against the Qing without any European allies. The decision falls into a vote, and the government announces…"
 secondopiumwar.5.a:0 "It an excellent proposal!"
 secondopiumwar.5.b:0 "We are not interested."
 secondopiumwar.6.t:0 "The British cooperate!"
 secondopiumwar.6.d:0 ""
 secondopiumwar.6.a:0 "Time to lay our eyes upon China..."
 secondopiumwar.7.t:0 "Britain refuses!"
 secondopiumwar.7.d:0 "The British parliament has announced their refusal of our proposed coalition, stating that Britain herself needs no help from other powers in their conquest of the Qing. The refusal comes as a strain on our relations, and the public have already begun calling for a denunciation of the British parliament’s decision. Without the cooperation of the British who are spearheading the war, it would be inopportune to intervene as it stands currently."

 secondopiumwar.8.t:0 "An Ultimatum by [ENG.GetNameDef]!"
 secondopiumwar.8.d:0 "The British have sent us an ultimatum regarding our recent capture and detainment of their Chinese ship and it’s crew, the Arrow. They have demanded that the crew be released at once, and in true British fashion have also used our actions as political leverage to also demand the right for Chinese citizens to emigrate using their vessels. It comes as no surprise that the British have begun sailing warships up to our cities’ coastline and walls, surrounding their trade ports to enforce their demands. Viceroy Ye Mingchen has already begun the process of releasing some of the prisoners, but with the arrival of the British demand comes the possibility of the sullying of our honor and dignity. How shall our government respond?"
 secondopiumwar.8.a:0 "And they think we will accept this drivel?"
 secondopiumwar.8.b:0 "Perhaps it would be the best for us to accept..."
 secondopiumwar.9.t:0 "[QNG.GetNameDef] bows to the Coalition!"
 secondopiumwar.9.d:0 "An envoy and request for a meeting had arrived on the local governor’s desk today, stating the Qing administration is willing to negotiate the terms demanded by our ultimatum. After a firm denial of negotiations and a demand for unconditional acceptance, more diplomats came to announce the Qing government’s compliance with our ultimatum. This diplomatic victory and humiliation brings with it a relieving force as an uprising in India has forced our hand and attention towards it instead of the situation in China."
 secondopiumwar.9.a:0 "It is up to [ENG.GetNameDef] to draft a treaty now..."
 secondopiumwar.9.b:0 "It is up to us to draft a treaty now..."
 secondopiumwar.10.t:0 "[QNG.GetNameDef] rejects British Ultimatum!"
 secondopiumwar.10.d:0 "Envoys from the Qing government’s palace have confirmed and concluded talks with British diplomats, announcing that the Qing government will comply with the British demands as stated in their ultimatum. British ships have begun sailing out of the vicinity of the Canton region as they comply with their end of negotiations. With this diplomatic embarrassment on the world stage, one wonders how much more China is willing to take before something happens."

 secondopiumwarnew.2.t:0 "Join the British Against Qing?"
 secondopiumwarnew.2.d:0 "The British are making preparations to attack the Qing at Canton, they have previously tried to persuade us to join in a coalition against the Chinese. We have received complaints from our envoy in China, Baron Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros, over the execution of a French missionary, Father Auguste Chapdelaine, by Chinese local authorities in Guangxi province.\n\nHowever, many times we have suffered the death of missionaries for which no military vengeance occurred. So this will easily be spun as Imperialist gain.\n\nOn the other hand, the political situation wherein Britain's victory is inevitable and so it would only be wise to have a chance to gain the rewards also"

It must be clear to them that we are likely to win the Second Opium War and they wish to reap the rewards also. Forming this Coalition with the French would mean we don’t have to commit as many of our own forces in the assault, freeing up much needed troops in India. It would also guarantee our success, if we were to win the war and not allow the French to help, they would be forever bitter…"

 secondopiumwarnew.4.t:0 "British Send Ultimatum!"
 secondopiumwarnew.4.d:0 "The British had been permitted access to Canton (Guangzhou) at the end of the First Opium War under the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, but were being illegally barred from entry by its viceroy Ye Mingchen. In 1856, there had been a series of attacks on the Thirteen Factories and its residences, culminating with their complete destruction by fire. This and the seizure of a foreign ship led the British to assemble a force to demand reparations.\n\nthe British High Commissioner to China, Lord Elgin, wrote to Ye demanding that he implement in full the trade and access agreements made in the 1842 Treaty of Nanking that ended the First Opium War and that he pay reparations for British losses in the war so far. Elgin promised that if Ye agreed within ten days then British and French forces would cease offensive actions, though they would retain possession of key forts until a new peace treaty was signed."

 secondopiumwarnew.5.d:0 "With the outbreak of the Second Opium War and an Anglo-French alliance banded against the Qing Empire, it is clear the Qing state cannot withstand the pressure of the West. The newly-ratified Treaty of Tianjin has forced the flow of commercial trade to continue throughout eleven ports across the Chinese coast, this time including the United States and Russia despite lack of combat. The Great Powers now watch closely with the intention of carving a slice out of the weakened Qing Empire."
 secondopiumwarnew.5.a:0 "Sign It..."
 secondopiumwarnew.6.t:0 "The Qing Refuse!"
 secondopiumwarnew.6.d:0 "Ye's reply was that Britain had effectively abandoned its rights with regards to Canton through eight years of inactivity, that the cause of the war (the loss of the merchant ship Arrow) had been of the British making and that he could not sign a new peace treaty because the 1842 treaty had been decreed by the emperor to last for 10,000 years. Elgin boarded HMS Furious on 17 December and sailed upriver towards Canton. On 21 December, Elgin ordered British Admiral Michael Seymour, French Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly and British General Charles van Straubenzee to take Canton and handed over full operational control."

 secondopiumwarnew.8.d:0 "With our defeat in Canton, which was meant to be an easy victory, we must now contemplate whether we continue to commit our forces in China. The British have assured us this defeat will not be repeated and that they are committing more of their own forces.

 secondopiumwarnew.11.d:0 "The main battle began with a naval bombardment throughout the day and night. The next day troops landed, taking a small fort, by Kupar Creek to the south-east of the city. The Chinese had thought that the attacking forces would try to capture Magazine Hill before they moved on the city walls, but on the morning after a naval bombardment ending at 9am European troops climbed the city walls with little resistance. They had arrived at the wall half an hour early and so faced fire from their own guns.\n\nOver 4,700 British and Indian troops scaled the city walls. The walls were occupied for a week, then the troops moved into the streets of the city that contained over 1,000,000 people. Commissioner Ye Mingchen was captured and taken to Calcutta."

 secondopiumwarnew.15.d:0 "Shortly after we signed the Treaty of Tianjin, the Qing imperial court agreed to the disadvantageous treaties, hawkish ministers prevailed upon the Xianfeng Emperor to resist Western encroachment. If we break the treaty it is almost certain we will risk clashing with the western nations once again. We can order the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen to guard the Taku Forts and Sengge Rinchen to reinforce the forts with additional artillery pieces.\n\nHowever, should we risk clashing with the technologically superior west?

 secondopiumwarnew.17.d:0 "The Second Battle of Taku Forts took place. A British naval force with 2,200 troops and 21 ships, under the command of Admiral Sir James Hope, sailed north from Shanghai to Tianjin with newly appointed European envoys for the embassies in Beijing. British forces blew up the iron obstacles that the Chinese had placed in the Baihe River. The next day, the British forces sought to forcibly sail into the river, and shelled the Taku Forts. Low tide and soft mud prevented their landing, accurate fire from Sengge Rinchen's cannons sank four gunboats and severely damaged two others. American Commodore Josiah Tattnall III, although under orders to maintain neutrality, declared "blood is thicker than water", and provided covering fire to protect the British convoy's retreat.\n\nThe Third Battle of Taku Forts took place. London once more dispatched Lord Elgin with a force of 11,000 British troops under General James Hope Grant. They carried out a landing near Beitang some 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) from the Taku Forts, which they captured after three weeks.\n\nPeace talks between the West and China will soon begin... again."

 secondopiumwarnew.18.d:0 "We have won once again in China, with peace talks beginning in Beijing soon, we must decide on how to proceed during the talks.

 secondopiumwarnew.21.d:0 "The Xianfeng Emperor dispatched ministers for peace talks, but the British diplomatic envoy, Harry Parkes, has been accused of insulting the imperial emissary during the talks. Word has arrived that Parkes was arrested in retaliation. Also captured were a number of British and French officers, Sikh soldiers, and a journalist from The Times. Parkes and the others were imprisoned, tortured, and interrogated. The prisoners had been tortured by having their limbs bound with rope until their flesh was lacerated and became infected with maggots, and by having dung and dirt forced into their throats. Several were executed by beheading, their corpses fed to animals. Captured coolies who had worked for the allies were buried up to their necks and left to dogs.\n\nIt is clear the Qing are bitter about the defeat. However, if we leave our men to their fate this will hit our prestige. Should we send another expedition to rescue the captives and finally put an end to this charade?"

 secondopiumwarnew.30.t:0 "Russia Send Ultimatum!"
 secondopiumwarnew.30.d:0 "Since the reign of Catherine the Great, Russia had desired to become a naval power in the Pacific. It did so by annexing Kamchatka Peninsula and establishing the naval outpost of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in 1740, naval outposts in Russian America and near the Amur watershed, encouraging Russians to go there and settle, and slowly developing a strong military presence in the Amur region. The Qing Empire  never governed that region effectively or conducted territorial surveys, and these Russian advances went unnoticed.\n\nGovernor-General of the Far East Nikolay Muraviev camped tens of thousands of troops on the borders of Mongolia and Manchuria, preparing to make legal Russian de facto control over the Amur from past settlement. Muraviev seized the opportunity when it was clear that we were losing the Second Opium War, and threatened us with a war on a second front, if we do not accept Russia Demands."

The lands north of the Amur River have been under Qing control since the Nerchinsk Treaty in 1689 between the Tsardom of Russia and the Qing Dynasty.
