 # Characters
 VIN_character_nguyen_tu_duc_desc:0 "Tự Đức was not the oldest son when he became emperor which caused resentment in his older brother, Nguyễn Phúc Hồng Bảo who subsequently tried to both seize the throne in a coup and, when that failed, to start a rebellion, he was eventually forced to commit suicide in 1854 and his four sons were banished from court, presumably to not stir anymore trouble.(One of the sons, Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Đạo, would start a short-lived rebellion under the name Đinh Đạo in 1866. The result was that all four sons were put to death, with their mother).\n\nTự Đức continued his policy of isolating Vietnam from the outside world and refusing to modernize the country. He was hostile towards Catholic missionaries and everyone who converted to Christianity fearing, not fully unfounded, that the Catholic Christians would eventually rebel against his rule.\n\nWhen Tự Đức ignored the French diplomat Charles de Montigny’s attempt to negotiate a trade deal between France and Vietnam the latter opened fire on the Vietnamese port of Da Nang as a warning to Tự Đức to stop the prosecution of Christians. Instead of heeding the warning the emperor increased the prosecution of Christians, convinced that they were plotting with foreign enemies. Despite repeated warnings that this was a suicidal policy he refused to budge and in 1859 the French, together with the Spanish, returned in force capturing Saigon. Despite fighting bravely, the Vietnamese army with antiquated weapons and tactics, didn’t stand a chance against the French. First after losing against the French in southern Vietnam, new rebellions popping up over the country and the French army marching towards his capital did Tự Đức stop the prosecution of the Catholics and liberalised his religious policies.\n\nTự Đức was forced to make humiliating concessions to the French in the treaty of Saigon in 1862 in which he was forced to cede the three southern provinces Bien Hoa, Gia Dinh and Dinh Tuong, the island of Poulo Condor and the city of Saigon.\n\nHumiliating as these concessions were Tự Đức preferred to make them so he could deal with the rebels that would most likely dispose and/or kill him.\n\nDespite being comprehensively defeated by the French, Tự Đức maintained his resistance to any kind of meaningful reform to open up and modernize Vietnam setting the stage for further French conquests. He did not live to see these conquests however when he died in 1883.  He would be the last independent ruler of Vietnam."
 VIN_character_nguyen_duc_duc_desc:0 "He was considered to decadent to rule by his uncle and predecessor, Tự Đức who had chosen another person as the successor. But Tự Đức three regents, controversially, appointed Dục Đức instead only to have him killed three days later for unclear reasons."
 VIN_character_nguyen_hiep_hoa_desc:0 "Hiệp Hòa first task was to reassert his family’s claim to the throne after Dục Đức. He must then decide what to do regarding the so-called Black Flag Army, a group of brigands that has assisted the Nguyen emperors in the fight against the French. As late as May 19th of this year the Black Flag managed to defeat a small force at Tonkin and kill its commander this has angered France and the risk of a greater French attack cannot been ruled out. Hiệp Hòa has only a short time to mend fences with the French this would of course risk a future clash with the Black Flag Army and any Vietnamese that are against French rule."
 VIN_character_nguyen_kien_phuc_desc:0 "As predicted and feared, Kiến Phúc died after a little more than 6 months on the throne. The throne has now gone to 12-year-old Hàm Nghi who is too young to lead. The French, who have become extremely irritated by the constant resistance from the Vietnamese to their rule decided it was time to gain direct rule of Vietnam. Accordingly, the new French military commander, General Count Roussel de Courcy, demands that the young emperor to come down from his throne and greet him as an equal, adding to the insult de Courcy rejected the gifts the emperor had sent him and demanded tribute from the Vietnamese!\n\nSurely this affront cannot stand. It is time to throw the arrogant French out and return Vietnam to its former glory."

 VIN_character_nguyen_thanh_thai_desc:0 "Young and intelligent, Thành Thái knows that he is being constantly watched by the French oppressors. He can’t even feel safe in his palace, if there was only a way to fool them. Is there a possibility to make them look away so the emperor can prepare for the right moment to finally overthrow the oppressors?\n \nIt is clear now that any kind of open rebellion is nothing more than political suicide and would cause untold harm to his beloved people, but one more day of French colonial rule is one to many. Could there be a third way to resist? Something so sneaky that the French won’t know what is coming until it is too late?"
