We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us.

TUS_the_tuscan_economy:0 "The Tuscan Economy"
TUS_the_tuscan_economy_desc:0 " If we are to become more than just a state to be dictated by foreign powers, we must develop an economy. Turning our focus here will benefit all of Tuscany."
TUS_the_sharecropping_debates:0 "The Sharecropping Debate"
TUS_the_sharecropping_debates_desc:0 "Due to our agrarian economy, it is obvious that sharecropping should be considered, seeing it’s success in the American south with its cotton industry. While a larger harvest would benefit us, this may upset the people as it will most definitely bring more of the poor into debt with landlords. This must be decided before we go any further with agriculture. "
TUS_textile_industry:0 "The Textile Industry"
TUS_textile_industry_desc:0 "The textile industry is something that many have made profits off of, especially in England. We would be foolish to not take advantage of its growth to further boost our economic ambitions."
TUS_the_artisans:0 "The Artisans"
TUS_the_artisans_desc:0 "Like much of the Italian peninsula, our economy is dominated by artisan-based industry. With our economy on the way to growing, it is pivotal that we make use of the artisans within our country. Their skill would be much needed in our workforce, and it will help increase our profits from exports with their talents utilized."
TUS_ridolfis_experiment:0 "Ridolfi's Experiment"
TUS_ridolfis_experiment_desc:0 "Ridolfi is a man that could bring the reform that Tuscany needs. If wages inspire our workers to work harder, perhaps it would be worth trying this. Productivity is what will keep us thriving, especially with our agrarian economy. However, a significant conflict has erupted between Ridolfi’s supporters and his critics. This may be too expensive, which might mean losing more money than we need to. This must be settled as we work on our agricultural sector."
TUS_reform_elsewhere:0 "Reform Elsewhere"
TUS_reform_elsewhere_desc:0 "Despite the promising aspects of Ridolfi's experimentation in the Agricultural sectors, our ministers have never been fond of changes the Tuscan economic outlook. We must look for a different solution, the workers are not the tools we need, though it is becoming clear that the estates might be the ones receiving more power, which will make us more popular with the upper class, the ones with actual power."
TUS_land_reclamation:0 "Land Reclamation"
TUS_land_reclamation_desc:0 " Innovation is what we need and with our agrarian economy, it is a doctrine we must utilize to maintain our economy. Making artificial land would give us more land to farm and more land for the estates to control, which can kickstart our agricultural sector above the rest of Italy."
TUS_power_to_the_estates:0 "Power to the Estates"
TUS_power_to_the_estates_desc:0 "The estates are what makes us profits, workers may be important but with no estates, there would be no farms for us to profit off of. We must give the necessary power to the estates that allows them to work as efficiently as possible, which would only bring more into our pockets."
TUS_introduce_wage_labour:0 "Introduce Wage Labor"
TUS_introduce_wage_labour_desc:0 "According to Ridolfi’s plans, we will introduce wages for workers which will increase our worker’s productivity for a small cost. This will also reduce tensions when it comes to sharecropping, a small price to pay for the stability of our nation."
TUS_curtail_innovation:0 "Curtail Innovation"
TUS_curtail_innovation_desc:0 "Why fix what works? Making artificial land does not help us, the productivity of our workers does! The work they do, which has increased due to the wages we have given them, is enough for us to move forward. We must stomp out outrageous ideas of innovation, and stick to what works."
TUS_power_to_the_workers:0 "Power to the Workers"
TUS_power_to_the_workers_desc:0 "With the new reforms we have made, worker productivity is at its absolute height! Fields are being worked with a national drive and with much needed stability being brought within our lower-class populace. By giving power to the workers, we are getting more profits along with a more stable agricultural society."
TUS_continue_with_free_trade:0 "Continue with Free Trade"
TUS_continue_with_free_trade_desc:0 "The Grand Duke and his government have long been proponents of Free Trade. Exports are something we must utilize if we want to be a shining star in Italian economics. With artisan talents and a workforce with growing skill, we have the methods to create economic interests for other nations to invest in. Not only will our economy grow, but we will gain much needed trade relations as well."
TUS_protect_tuscan_production:0 "Protect Tuscan Production"
TUS_protect_tuscan_production_desc:0 "We must keep a firm hold on our products, our resources, and our economic independence. Depending on foreign trade could put us in an economic disaster and trade relations can threaten our isolation. We must stop the excessive exports, so we can put our own resources to our own use, which will be far more reliant than exports."
TUS_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside:0 "Consumers Exist not in the Countryside"
TUS_consumers_exist_not_in_the_countryside_desc:0 "If we are to make a real profit, we must accept the fact that our economy does not depend on our internal powers but more so from foreign buyers, regardless of our plans on trade, it is important that we maintain some level of trade."
TUS_but_outside_the_countryside:0 "But Outside the Country"
TUS_but_outside_the_countryside_desc:0 "In the words of a Livorian banker, the Tuscan market is too small compared to what it could be. We must put efforts towards expanding the market if we are to reach our economic peak. We must expand our reach through trade, which will help our economy run along smoothly."
TUS_the_expanding_grain_market:0 "The Expanding Grain Market"
TUS_the_expanding_grain_market_desc:0 "Grain has become a valued and more necessary resource that provides an opportunity for us to take advantage of. With increased harvests and our agricultural sector being expanded and improved upon, we can export grain to foreign powers with a guaranteed profit."
TUS_the_iron_industry:0 "The Iron Industry"
TUS_the_iron_industry_desc:0 " Iron is a resource that is growing in value which we have. We must dig deep and greedily, as with technology moving forward that utilizes iron, it will be important for us to be a step ahead, which benefits both sides of our trading policies. "
TUS_learn_from_leghorn:0 "Learn from Leghorn"
TUS_learn_from_leghorn_desc:0 "If Tuscany is to prosper, then we must learn from the ways of Livorno. The profits that were made from a free port city is something that we Tuscans should take advantage of, and it can benefit our intentions to increase the Tuscan market’s reach to Europeans. Just in the way of Livorno, we shall make our port cities hubs for trading profit."
TUS_modernisation:0 "Modernization"
TUS_modernisation_desc:0 "As we push economically, it is vital that we recognize the need for modernization, we must study foreign techniques, to replace our outdated techniques and equipment. This is needed so we can push Tuscany’s capabilities to their limit. "
TUS_not_industrialisation:0 "Not Industrialization"
TUS_not_industrialisation_desc:0 "It is being misunderstood that modernization is being taken as industrialization. Though it is simply not true. We must reaffirm that we are making the best out of agrarian technology, rather than resorting to industrial efforts for the sake of our economic stability."
TUS_social_concerns:0 "Social Concerns"
TUS_social_concerns_desc:0 "With the world changing, and Tuscany along with it, our social society has grown reasonably worried. We must address the concerns of the lower and upper class to help maintain our economic stability. Along with this, it can bring much needed trust back into the government from both sides. "
TUS_stability_for_workers:0 "Stability for Workers"
TUS_stability_for_workers_desc:0 "While there is debate on the priority of land owners and workers, it is also known that both are vital. We must provide stability for the lower class workers. After-all, without anyone to work the farms, there would be no harvest for us to profit off of. "
TUS_and_for_land_owners:0 "And for Land Owners"
TUS_and_for_land_owners_desc:0 "Land owners are a very important factor in our growing agricultural setting, without them, there would be no farms for us to profit off of and there would be no harvest as well. We must provide stability for them as well, as we push Tuscany to a golden age of agricultural modernization and improvement."

# Tuscan Events
tuscany.1.t:0 "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany"
tuscany.1.d:0 "The Grand Duchy of Tuscany has long been ruled by the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, interrupted only during Napoleon's conquest of Italy. During the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duke Leopold II embraced liberalism and our soldiers fought side by side with those from Sardinia, The Papal States, and the Kingdom of Naples. Overthrown by popular revolt still, Leopold could only return to rule Tuscany with the assistance of Austria, whose garrison only left in 1855. With the liberal constitution revoked the politics of the Duchy are stagnant. An incompetant ruling class rules over the land of Tuscany. As Sardinia-Piedmont is beginning to suggest Italian Unity our people become restless. Will the traditions of our Duchy lead us to dust, or will we embrace the republican spirit of our people?"
tuscany.1.a:0 "It is a trying time"
tuscany.2.t:0 "The Tuscan Economy"
tuscany.2.d:0 "The Tuscan Economy is almost entirely agrarian. The largest export from our nation is grain. Despite the agrarian occupation that many of our citizens hold, there is a growing artisan industry as the need for manufacturing increases. Rails in the Duchy are in the midst of an upgrade as work with the Austrian rail companies assists the connections we make between our capital and the port city of Livorno. Livorno is the home of trade and industry for Tuscany. Textiles and Iron flow from the port as the base for our economy. However, a battle is brewing between land owners and peasants, and bosses and workers."
tuscany.2.a:0 "More Problems to Solve"
tuscany.3.t:0 "The Sharecropping Debate"
tuscany.3.d:0 "Feudalism has never really left Tuscany. The Sharecroppers, mezzadros, has a compact with the landowner to cultivate land and share profits from sales in return for housing, seeds, and other minor goods. The merits of this system are being called into question by our politicians, especially the liberal ones. More and more farmers are demanding the rights to own their own land."
tuscany.3.a:0 "The future of mezzadria is in question"
tuscany.4.t:0 "The Ridolfi Experiment"
tuscany.4.d:0 "Cosimo Ridofli operates a fine winery in Tuscany. As the issues with sharecropping influence many land owners, Ridolfi has proposed possibly introducing wage labour on a wider scale in Tuscany. Wage labour is something usually reserved to those who work with the artisans or other part of the economy. There is disagreement if introducing wage labour to agriculture could solve our issues or make them worse."
tuscany.4.a:0 "We must introduce wage labour"
tuscany.4.b:0 "Our reforms must be elsewhere"
tuscany.5.t:0 "The Political Scene"
tuscany.5.d:0 "Leopold II is not a very popular leader. His dynasty is propped up by Austria and their empire influences our nation a great deal. One condition of his return was the removal of the constitution, something the liberal politicians seek to have returned. There are minor legislative powers in the government but much power is centralized. As rumors that Sardinia-Piedmont will make its attempt to unify Italy soon are spreading, so is discontent and shadow organizations."
tuscany.5.a:0 "The future is unknown"
tuscany.6.t:0 "Memories of 1848"
tuscany.6.d:0 "Following the revolutions of 1848 the Grand Duchy of Tuscany joined the Sardinian coalition in the fight against Austria. Our troops eventually pulled out along with those of the Two Sicilies and Papal States, and our people revolted against Duke Leopold II. The Austrian Empire eventually put down the revolt and reinstated Leopold, at the cost of removing the constitution granted after the revolutions. The people do not have fond memories of the events that unfolded."
tuscany.6.a:0 "An unfortunate legacy"

 sardinia.9.d:0 "A number of events promoted Piedmont’s prestige in Italy and abroad. In March 1854 France and England intervened in support of the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Crimean War. To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us. Together, the two leaders will plan an invasion of the Austrian-controlled part of our beautiful peninsula, and drive out foreign influence.

The Treaty of Stupinigi in 1817 formalized the relationship between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Protectorate of Monaco. The treaty was overall devastating for Monaco and much of the wealth of the nation was lost, which was further inflamed when a majority of the nation declared independence during the Revolutions of 1848. Since then the areas of Roquebrune-Menton have been under the Savoy administration to cease violence in the area. As the struggle for unification is underway, many question what status Monaco will play in it?

After the Crimean War the topic of Unification became something more familiar to the European Nations, and now at the meeting at Plombieres there will be an opprotunity to form an alliance with a major power in Europe. We should hope to lead a military alliance against the Austrians, and ensure the capture of Lombardy-Venetia for Sardinia-Piedmont.

sardinia.95.t:0 "Casus Belli"
sardinia.95.d:0 "As we begin the meeting the first topic of the alliance will be the casus belli for the war against Austria. The obvious options are to use the war to enfore trade treaty violations by Austria and her minor state allies in the peninsula, but there is a chance that this might be seen as a weak reason for war by the European powers. Another option is to use the presence of Austrian troops in Rome and Bologna as a justification for war, which might gain some favor among the European powers. However, the French are also stationing troops in Rome, so the parallels may be too similar to use it as a justification."
sardinia.95.a:0 "Trade Treaty Violations"
sardinia.95.b:0 "Bologna Garrison"
sardinia.96.t:0 "Casus Belli"
sardinia.96.d:0 "The other side of our alliance has offered up two possible casus belli that could be used against the Austrians. However, neither are suitable to use in order to wage a war of the scale we need to. The proposed casus belli's being enforcing trade treaty obligations, and using the Bologna Garrison by the Austrians as an excuse for war. With the parallels between our troops in Rome and the Austrians in Bologna, using that as a casus belli could be seen as hypocritical. The trade treaty obligations would not be strong enough to be seen as legitimate cause for war."

sardinia.97.t:0 "Casus Belli - A Different Approach"
sardinia.97.d:0 "With our confirming that the two prior suggested Casus Belli would be too weak to wage a war on, our politicians have managed to formulate quite the plan in order to not only provide a cause for war, but to ensure Austria is the attacker. Using the fact that Duchy of Medna and Reggio leader Francis V had refused to accept Napoleon III as the true ruler of France. If the Modense citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-Allied government it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opprotunity to make a statement about Austrian influence in the Italian Peninsula without directly going to war. The outrage in Vienna might just be enough to cause them to go to war."

If the Modense citizens were to request protection from their Austrian-Allied government it would give Sardinia-Piedmont the perfect opprotunity to make a statement about Austrian influence in the Italian Peninsula without directly going to war. The outrage in Vienna might just be enough to cause them to go to war."
sardinia.98.a:0 "Genius!"
sardinia.99.t:0 "Political Structure of Italy"
sardinia.99.d:0 "The Political structure of Italy, should the war against Austria go well, is something that might cause some fracturing in the alliance. With the ultimate French goal to regain influence in the peninsula lost in the Congress of Vienna - through the means of an Italian Confederation, and the goal of Piedmont being creating at least a northern Italian Kingdom. Hopes of Piedmont for complete unification are not to be ignored, however."
sardinia.99.a:0 "This will be an interesting topic"
sardinia.100.t:0 "Our Position on the Confederation"
sardinia.100.d:0 "As the French prepare to lay out their plan for the Italian Peninsula, we must begin to think about whether the confederation is something that we should go along with. Naturally, we can always give the French our assurances now and see if the future allows us to change the agreement, but we are not in a good position to deny the French goal of domination in Italy. With that we are stuck in this position, with the hope to escape at first chance or at the very least to renegociate the terms of the confederation."

sardinia.101.t:0 "The North of Italy"
sardinia.101.d:0 "Under the current plans for the political structure of Italy, the north of the peninsula would be under control of Sardinia-Piedmont under the title of a Kingdom of Northern Italy. This would see the Austrians removed from Northern italy and replaced with a more powerful Italian state."
sardinia.101.a:0 "Interesting"
sardinia.102.t:0 "Central Italy"
sardinia.102.d:0 "Central Italy under the confederation would be under control of a French allied state. Given the current association of the central states with Austria, a new monarch may have to be found but the current regent in Parma the lady of Artois has had her named tossed around as a possible leader of this Napoleonic-esque central state. The Pope would remain in Rome as the head of the Italian Confederation."
sardinia.102.a:0 "Hmmm"
sardinia.104.t:0 "The South of Italy"
sardinia.104.d:0 "In the South of Italy the current Bourbon monarchy would likely be replaced with a relative of the French Bonapartes, unless the Two Sicilies can be convinvec of the merits of joining the confederation. With British interests in the Sulphur mines of Sicily this could cause a confilct between our nations as the balance of power in Europe is drawn into question."

sardinia.106.t:0 "Military Composition"
sardinia.106.d:0 "The first, and maybe one of the biggest, topics of the entire meeting is on the military composition of the alliance. Given the war against Austria is over Italian soil we are eager to have the lead against Austria, in order to revenge the defeat in 1848. For the French the importance to show dominance in italy and revenge the Congress of Vienna is aparant. Whoever leads the military alliance will have quite the benefit in the war."

sardinia.106.b:0 "Request that we lead"
sardinia.107.t:0 "The Military Composition"
sardinia.107.d:0 "As the Piedmontese have sent their request for how the military alliance will be structured, and who will ultimately lead the efforts against Austria there is much to consider. As the dominant power in Europe compared to the Italians it would be more appropriate for us to lead the armies in Italy, however, the Italians are very nationalistic people and the presence of strong Italian leaders could pay off to rally the populace and inspire troops. Either way, the leader of the war will be an important position."

There are many reasons as to why the King has been hesitant. The Emperor's brother is not known for his loyalty to companions, and his age difference between the kings daughter it not to ignored.

POLITICS_Camillo_Benso_di_Cavour_DESC:0 "Genevan by birth, his mother brought into the Cavour family the influence of Geneva, a city open to all the political, religious, and social movements of the period. The French Revolution imperilled the possessions of the Cavours because of their close ties with the Ancien Régime, but Camillo’s father reestablished the family in an eminent position in Napoleonic society, so all losses were compensated. As the younger son who could not hope for the economic and social position that would fall to his elder brother, Camillo saw a brilliant career open up before him under the protection of the court of Charles Albert, Prince of Savoy and Piedmont. \n\n His lack of enthusiasm for the court position and his open ridicule of the page-boy's uniform he was obliged to wear created controversy and confirmed the growing suspicions of rebellious intent within the young Camillo. He was influenced by the liberal ideas of the French writers Benjamin Constant and François Guizot, and his adversaries remained those of his childhood: paternalistic absolutism; legitimist reactionaries representing the landed interests, the aristocracy, and the clergy; and the union of throne and altar. His father got him appointed mayor of a village south of Turin and also became the administrator of extensive holdings in the vicinity belonging to his uncles. Social interests began to absorb him: the problems of poverty and prisoner education became the subjects of his research. In 1834, he wrote a memoir on poverty in Piedmont, which was published the following year in London in the Report from His Majesty's Commissioners for inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the Poor Laws. A second pamphlet on the history of the Poor Laws in England was edited and published by Cavour in 1835 at Turin.\n\n His transition to politics was completed when King Charles Albert decided to embark on measures of reform and to concede a certain amount of freedom to the press. This prompted Cavour to offer his services as a volunteer until, on being elected a deputy in the Third Legislature, he began to fight for the approval of a peace treaty with Austria, although the extremists of the left wanted to continue a war that was, in effect, already lost. In October 1850, he was offered the post of Minister of Agriculture and soon became the most active and influential member of the Cabinet. The European drama into which Cavour was drawn against his will began in 1854 with the Crimean War, with the combined efforts of France, Great Britain, and Piedmont to secure the prosperity of the Ottoman Empire against the encroaching Russian Empire. \n\n Cavour advocates for a complete Anti-Austrian movement across the Piedmontese lands to fulfill Risorgimento and unite the Italian lands. Papal misgovernment in central Italy and the rough autocratic rule of the Bourbons in Southern Italy have guided Cavour into signing deals with the Major Powers to secure backing in the coming wars..."
