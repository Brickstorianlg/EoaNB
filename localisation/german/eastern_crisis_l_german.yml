The movement to help Herzegovina and the Bosniaks also quickly spread to Russia. The main source of support for the insurgents was the money donated to the Slavic Committees in Moscow and St. Petersburg by the Russian population in the most remote areas of the country. The total amount of donations sent to Herzegovina likely amounts to hundreds of thousands of rubles.\n\nThe struggle for freedom in Bosnia and Herzegovina was also supported by numerous volunteers from Italy, as well as the South Slavic countries of Croatia, Dalmatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and, of course, Russia. In the summer of 1875, members of the Russian revolutionary nationalist movement fought among the Herzegovinian partisans. With their help the uprising might be successful."
