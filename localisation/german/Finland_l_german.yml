If there has been anger, then it has been directed mainly at local officials. Social order seems not to be under any kind of threat since people are more focused on returning to normal lives again. This will sadly take time, although final numbers will probably never be known, the death toll has been horrible. Some regions report that one in five have succumbed during the last two years. Lessons have been learned, however. More programs have been launched to improve the communications in Finland and to increase the diversity of the Finnish agriculture, those hoping that recurrence of a famine like this will never happen again."

In 1818, a channel had been dug to drain the spring floodwaters from the Suvanto into Lake Ladoga. However, this unexpectedly had caused the formation of a whole new river, the Taipaleenjoki. This new river has in recent years begun to drain Lake Suvanto of its contents, decreasing its water level by 7 meters and drying out the Kiviniemi waterway. Today the village of Sakkola dug a new riverbed through the Kiviniemi between the convergence of the Vuoksi River and Lake Suvanto. Unfortunately, this has inadvertently caused the stream to reverse in direction, causing the formation of a new river rapid called the Vuoksi Falls and rendering the navigation of the Kiviniemi impossible."
