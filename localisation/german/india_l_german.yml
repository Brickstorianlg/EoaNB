 ###Sepoy Rebellion###
 ###FOCUS###
 SRS_march_to_delhi:0 "March to Delhi"
 SRS_march_to_delhi_desc:0 "Delhi, The capital of the old Mughal Empire is currently undefended by any british troops and is ripe for the taking.As well as this the current Mughal Emperor holds the city and if we get him on our side, our cause will be greatly improved."
 SRS_pettion_to_bahadur_shad:0 "Send a Pettion to Bahadur Shah"
 SRS_pettion_to_bahadur_shad_desc:0 "The Mughal Empire once held much of india in its grasp , although it is now relegated to a small successor state it still holds the respect of the common man. Its current emperor Bahadur Shah II still holds the capital of delhi and if we are to be successful we must gain his favour."
 SRS_holding_a_formal_court:0 "Holding a Formal Court"
 SRS_holding_a_formal_court_desc:0 "It has been a long time since Bahadur Shah has held court, now he has sided with our cause it is time for him to hold court once again."
 SRS_declaration_of_imperial_ambitions:0 "Declaration of Imperial Ambitions"
 SRS_declaration_of_imperial_ambitions_desc:0 "With our organisation secured we should now reveal our ambitions in this war and in Hindustan in general. We strive to drive out the imperialist British and to restore the Mughal Empire with Bahadur Shah as our rightful leader!"
 SRS_fate_of_hindustan:0 "The Fate of Hindustan"
 SRS_fate_of_hindustan_desc:0 "With our victory in the conflict against the British the fate of Hindustan is now in our hands. We have managed the drive out the British from Northern India and reestablished the Mughal Empire. The Princes must decide - if they want to be on our side or aganist us."
 
 ###Military
 SRS_forging_military:0 "Forging a Military"
 SRS_forging_military_desc:0 "To be able to stand up to the British we need to unite the units fighting for our ambitions and establish a Mughal Army! A united and centralised army could fight better and more efficient against our foes!"
 SRS_finding_commanders:0 "Finding Commanders"
 SRS_finding_commanders_desc:0 "We have come across a problem within our armies. Our soldiers may be exceptionally trained but the Sepoy divisions will only follow the command of their Sepoy officers. Every attempt of us to establish some kind of high command in our new army has failed. We need to find some commanders that are respected by the entire army as fast as possible to quickly raise a high command!"
 SRS_commanders_in_field:0 "Commanders in the Field"
 SRS_commanders_in_field_desc:0 "Our commanders and the high command should be in the fields and near the frontline, so that they have the opportunity to quickly adapt to the current situation during the fights and experience firsthand, how the conditions are."
 SRS_command_from_palace:0 "Commanders in the Palace"
 SRS_command_from_palace_desc:0 "Instead of putting our high command at risk in a possible involvement in the battles, they should stay in the palace and put up the plans from there. Perhaps they could inform our Emperor about their plans and adaptations could be made by the officers during the fights."
 SRS_cohesion_force:0 "Force Cohesion with the Army"
 SRS_cohesion_force_desc:0 "If we want to achieve our goals, we ultimately have to work together as a unit, as good as we possibly can. Everyone, from the high command to the ordinary soldier, has to subordinate his own interests under the goal of restoring the Empire."

 ###Religion
 SRS_dealing_relgion:0 "Dealing with the Religious Issue"
 SRS_dealing_relgion_desc:0 "Presenting us as the successor to the Mughal Empire will lead to us focusing more on our Muslim population, which means that the believers of the other religions may feel alienated. We have some options in hand to prevent this from happening."
 SRS_a_promise_of_religion_freedom:0 "A Promise of Religious Freedom"
 SRS_a_promise_of_religion_freedom_desc:0 "Our first option consists of deciding to enforce no state religion and grant religious freedom in our new Empire. This would definitely eradicate any existing any religious problems we have currently with the Sikhs and Christians, which came to India with the Brits, and the other religions. But in exchange this could dissatisfy some of our Islamic and Hindi followers, which would like to see their religion enforced as the state religion."
 SRS_bring_the_sikhs_on_side:0 "Bring the Sikhs on Side"
 SRS_bring_the_sikhs_on_side_desc:0 "The Sikhs have long been resentful over the rule of the British. The earlier animosities between our former Mughal Empire and the Sikhs mean that they support the East India Company in their fight against us. But we could pull them to our side if we reaffirm our religious freedom to the Sikhs in our Empire. The Shiks joing us could relieve our war situation, as our Northern Front would get cleared."
 SRS_towards_a_new_future:0 "Towards a new Future"
 SRS_towards_a_new_future_desc:0 "With our religious issues now solved and the war developing in our favour we look into a bright future!"
 SRS_muslim_hindu_joint_state:0 "A State for Both Faiths"
 SRS_muslim_hindu_joint_state_desc:0 "Our second option would be to recognise both the Islamic and the Hindi religions as state religions, making both of them equal and showing both groups of believers that they have something to fight for."
 SRS_unting_the_two_halfs:0 "Uniting the Two Halfs"
 SRS_unting_the_two_halfs_desc:0 "With both, Islam and Hinduism, being state religions and both of them having various supporters all over the Mughal Empire, perhaps we should try to unite both of the poles, both of the people and both of the religions? As unlikely as it may seem it could succeed, as shown by our unity during our rebellion."
 SRS_tolerance_given:0 "Tolerance Given"
 SRS_tolerance_given_desc:0 "We have managed to unite the people, which believe in Hindi and Islam and formed a communtity, where both of the believers can live independent and soon in peace. Whilst the other religions may not have the same treatment as Islam and Hinduism have, we will show them and their believers that we tolerate them, as well as Hinduism and Islam will be tolerated by all the communtities in India."
 SRS_request_declaration_jihad:0 "Request a Declaration of Jihad"
 SRS_request_declaration_jihad_desc:0 "As the successor to the Islamic Mughal Empire our new Empire will be a Islamic one as well. We have no need in naming a second state religion or introducing religious freedomes, because our glorious Mughal Empire did show that it lasted for a long time and was one of the leaders in Asia and at the level the Europeans were in the middle ages! And even the majority of our population is islamic, we would just risk unnecessary conflicts in a already complicated war."
 SRS_stoking_the_flames:0 "Stoking the Flames"
 SRS_stoking_the_flames_desc:0 "Since a lot of religions are present in Hindustan, we will have some difficultities with our current course of rebuilding the Mughal Empire and establish a Jihad in India. But if we present the other religions as aggressor in this conflict we may get some support from others."
 SRS_drawing_from_the_zealous:0 "Drawing from the Zealous"
 SRS_drawing_from_the_zealous_desc:0 "With the majority our soldiers being muslims, fighting for not only the Mughal Empire and its population, but also for Allah and Islam will give them extra motivation to drive out the British and their puppets. But on the other side, other soldiers with other faiths may feel alienated and stop fighting on our side."
 
 ###Mughal Empire###
 ###Political
 SRS_towards_the_future:0 "Towards the Future"
 SRS_towards_the_future_desc:0 "With our victory against the British we have managed to regain independence and have assumed control over a sizeable territory. With Britain and it's puppets unable to attack us anytime soon and no other regional power strong enough to risk a conflict with us, a bright future lies ahead of us."
 SRS_building_a_nation:0 "Building a Nation"
 SRS_building_a_nation_desc:0 "During the war we already have begun to restore some authorities in the executive and judicative branches and have decided on our religious and some of our militaristic approaches, but we still are not in a position where our statehood is secured. If we want to become a real nation we still have to decide on some issues and need to take the next step and reorganise our empire. Just then, our nation will be safe and secured."
 SRS_rebuilding_empire:0 "Rebulding the Mughal Empire"
 SRS_rebuilding_empire_desc:0 "In our independence war our ultimate goal was always to restore the Mughal Empire after driving out the British. It was one of the most developed and one of the strongest Asian nations, even challenging some of the European states. We should take the decision to rebuild the Empire with it's centralised government with Bahadur Shah at the top and subordinates, that follow and trust him."
 SRS_princely_federation:0 "Build a Federation of Princes"
 SRS_princely_federation_desc:0 "Even if the Mughal Empire was as glorious and strong as their nostalgic followers mention time after time, it ultimately ended in demise and was defeated and subdued by the Brits. Perhaps we should take this in consideration in our debate about the new state and try to avoid this situation happening again by building a new order. In this new order local princes would rule in a Mughal Federation, which could handle events more effective than a absolute monarchy did in the invasions of India."
 SRS_creating_a_administration:0 "Creating a Administration"
 SRS_creating_a_administration_desc:0 "Now that we have decided on a system our new state will be in, we should begin the task of (re-)building an administration in our territories."
 SRS_finding_those_with_gift_admin:0 "Finding the Gifted Administrators"
 SRS_finding_those_with_gift_admin_desc:0 "With the administration rebuilding, we need to take people into consideration, which will hold the positions we establish in our new administration."
 SRS_honoring_our_promises:0 "Honoring our Promises"
 SRS_honoring_our_promises_desc:0 "During the war we have made promises to our people and we will honor them. It's time to implement these promises and reform our laws."
 SRS_talks_about_future:0 "Talks about Future"
 SRS_talks_about_future_desc:0 "With our independence and political system now secured, we need to see what we can do in the future, what we perhaps even have to do in the future. We need to prepare, and for that, we need to hold talks with the decision-makers."
 SRS_finding_our_place:0 "Finding our Place"
 SRS_finding_our_place_desc:0 "With our independence came another important question. What is our position in this world? We aren't the power we used to be in Asia. The Qing have overcome us and various European powers probably have a interest in invading and colonising us once again. We need to know who stands by our side and who does not, we need to know who we can ally and trust to rebuild our state and position in the world without having to fear a backstabbing ally! In short, we need to find our position in this world."
 SRS_deciding_on_our_people:0 "Deciding on our People"
 SRS_deciding_on_our_people_desc:0 "When we talk about the future, we also have to talk about our population. We need to make clear, who is part of 'our people' and who is not, whom we support in our state and who doesn't need to expect any support by us. And in the end we have to decide, whether we want to follow the way we are going since the rebellion in the case of religion or if we need to change it."
 
 
 
 ###Military
 SRS_forging_a_military:0 "Forging a Military"
 SRS_forging_a_military_desc:0 "Whilst we have managed to organise a army strong enough to beat the British, we still don't have a army that is strong enough to resist a full-scale invasion by another country. We need to reorganise our army once again and need to begin to modernise our weaponry to be able to strenghten our army. This will lead to us being able to withstand a invasion by Imperialists or even to become active ourselves and regain our former territories in Hindustan. We have no time to lose!"
 SRS_issue_of_obtaining_modern_equipment:0 "Issues of Obtaining Modern Equipment"
 SRS_issue_of_obtaining_modern_equipment_desc:0 "During the reign of Britain in India, the equipment used by the Sepoys were not the most modern. With the withdrawal of Britain the supply of newer equipment into our empire stopped. But if we want to have a strong army, we need to have modern equipment. We have two ways of dealing with this issue."
 SRS_foreign_designs:0 "Foreign Designs"
 SRS_foreign_designs_desc:0 "The first one would be to buy weapons from abroad. This could be the easier way to obtain new weapons, as they are already produced and we just need to buy them. But a downside to this would be that we would make overselves dependent on foreign powers again - just after we obtained our independence. Is this a path we really want to persuade?"
 SRS_hindu_designs:0 "Hindu Designs"
 SRS_hindu_designs_desc:0 "Our second option would be to design and build these weapons ourselves. With that we could secure our own need for arms and stay independent in this industrial branch. But one of the problems if we want to go this way is that we are lacking a arms industry. So if we need to build those weapons, we have to invest into our industry. "
 SRS_lessons_from_the_war:0 "Lessons from the War"
 SRS_lessons_from_the_war_desc:0 "With the war against the British over, we need to analyse how we fought in this war and how successful our strategies were. We may be able to learn a thing or two and improve our army and strategies."
 SRS_retraining_sepoys:0 "Retraining Sepoys"
 SRS_retraining_sepoys_desc:0 "With our strategies and the war analysed we have the opportunity to extend the training and retrain our Sepoys and by that, improve the standing of our army."
 SRS_standing_military:0 "Standing Military"
 SRS_standing_military_desc:0 "Whilst a army consisting just of Sepoys was enough to defeat the unprepared British troops in India, it certainly would not be enough to hold up a standing, organised army, like the European states have. If we want to survive, we will need to reorganise our Sepoy troops into a real standing army!"
 SRS_new_tatics:0 "New Tactics"
 SRS_new_tatics_desc:0 "What we also need to do is to think about new tactics we could use in future conflicts and wars to surprise our enemies. That could go as far as saving us from us being invaded again, no matter if we are being invaded by Europeans or regional powers in Asia."
 SRS_ideas_of_artillery:0 "Ideas of Artillery"
 SRS_ideas_of_artillery_desc:0 "War did get a new facet with the begin of the Industrial Revolution at the end of the last century, with the usage of industrially produced Artilleries. We could look into this new aspect of war and try to use it for our needs. Using Artillary we could invent new tactics that help us defend better and more effective with just Infantry units."
 SRS_professinalising_the_volunteers:0 "Professionalising the Volunteers"
 SRS_professinalising_the_volunteers_desc:0 "During our last war, a lot of volunteers from all over India joined our cause, to defeat Britain and restore the Mughal Empire! Whilst using these volunteers helped us to defeat Britain and it's Indian holding, these volunteers don't have any warfare experience. If we want to incorporate them into our army, we need to give them a proper army education."
 SRS_national_reserves:0 "Found the National Reserves"
 SRS_national_reserves_desc:0 "With our volunteers having recieved a proper army education now, they can be incorporated in our army. But instead of incorporating them in our standing army outright, we could form a National Reserve, since having too many man in our army may be not effective, as there is no war approaching at the moment and we could need more men in our industry."
 SRS_a_professional_army:0 "A Professional army"
 SRS_a_professional_army_desc:0 "We have been modernising our army for quite some time now. We have modernised our weapons and our training. We have retrained our Commanders and Sepoys with the experiences and analysis from the war against the British and established a national reverse that will help us as soldiers in situations of war and as civilians in time of peace. And with that, the process of modernising our army is completed."

 ###EVENTS###
 sepoy.1.t:0 "The Sepoy Mutiny"
 sepoy.1.d:0 "For the last century, the English East India Company has continued to consolidate their rule over the Indian Subcontinent. These once thriving and sovereign peoples of the Rajas have been overpowered one by one, subjugated and conscripted for a power two oceans away and turned into a suffering colony to be exploited and ridiculed.\n \nOur Sepoy soldiers serving the British Crown are treated at best like dogs. The land reforms and taxes of the East India Company have pushed millions to the brink of their livelihoods. Now, the latest insult to the people of India has brought revolt, a rumor that the cartridges needed for the newly introduced Enfield Rifle are lubricated with Pig and Cow Oils. India is Britain’s Crown Jewel but they dare treat our faiths and traditions with such blasphemy!\n \nTens of thousands of Sepoy Soldiers have now mutinied against the British Banner, offering a new hope for the people of India. The Indian people have been oppressed for too long. The time to take action is now and take back our fatherland!"
 sepoy.1.a:0 "Their injustices will be paid by blood."
 sepoy.2.t:0 "A call to arms!"
 sepoy.2.d:0 "Our brothers in Sepoy have asked us, as one of the states not yet under British occupation, to join in their revolt! Shall we join them in their effort to drive out the colonialists from India?"
 sepoy.2.a:0 "Yes, join their glorious rebellion!"
 sepoy.2.b:0 "No, we would just get crushed under the British boot."
 sepoy.3.t:0 "Civilian Assistance"
 sepoy.3.d:0 "The hearts of our citizens are set aflame by the revolt, it seems, and in a major effort, many of them have come together during the last few days to erect fortifications in the cities of Delhi and Lucknow! Although hastily assembled, these forts will make it harder for the Brits to take these provinces!"
 sepoy.3.a:0 "Great!"
 sepoy.4.t:0 "Pressure from Sepoy"
 sepoy.4.d:0 "The Rebellion in Sepoy has severely affected our country - even though we are occupied by the British and therefore have to fight for them, our populace is extremely dissatisfied with our decision. The calls for us to abandon the British and join the Sepoy in their rebellion are getting louder and louder - what shall we do?"
 sepoy.4.a:0 "Join them - its about time we drove the British out."
 sepoy.4.b:0 "We must remain loyal to Britain."

 sepoy.11.d:0 "The Sepoy Rebellion, under the guide of Bahadur Shah, have sent a envoy guaranteeing us religious freedoms if we throw off the hated British. What shall our response be?"

 sepoy.12.t:0 "A Declaration from Delhi"
 sepoy.12.d:0 "blah blah religious rights get guaranteed, backlash from the Muslims and the Hindus"
 sepoy.12.a:0 "I'd hoped for more"
 sepoy.13.t:0 "The Issue of Religion"
 sepoy.13.d:0 "The Subcontinent of India has long been split by many religious denominations that too often have not intermingled well. The core of our nation, being a successor to the Mughal Empire, is focused on our muslim subjects. Which will likely alienate subjects of different religions within our nation. However in order to rule over all of the people of Hindustan we must make a decision on this question of religion."
 sepoy.13.a:0 "Time to make a decision"
 sepoy.14.t:0 "A Failure in Command"
 sepoy.14.d:0 "The recent reports coming in from the various skirmishes on the front convey the same message. Mirza Mughal, the son of Bahabur Shah, is incompetent. Appointed to the posistion of comander in chief when the Sepoys convinced Bahadur to join the rebellion. Mirza seems to be a failure and completely unsuited to military command. The question is now, who do we replace him with?"

 sepoy.17.d:0 "The Victory over the British rings hollow. For as soon as the peace treaty in Bombay was signed, Thousands of Princely states declared themselves independant. Those loyal to Bahadur Shah II in delhi have spent the last few weeks negotianting treaties and threating force against many of the new states in order to keep the Empire together. And the Empire endures. Now we must guide our reestablished nation into the future."
