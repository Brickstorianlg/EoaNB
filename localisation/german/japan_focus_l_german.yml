### INDUSTRALIZATION DECISIONS ###
JAP_industrialization_category:0 "The Industrial Revolution"
JAP_industrialization_category_desc:0 ""As with France, an important consequence of the British Industrial Revolution for China and Japan was military vulnerability. China was humbled by British sea power during the First Opium War, between 1839 and 1842, and the same threat became all too real for the Japanese as U.S. warships, led by Commodore Matthew Perry, pulled into Edo Bay in 1853. The reality that economic backwardness created military backwardness was part of the impetus behind Shimazu Nariakira’s plan to overthrow the shogunate and put in motion the changes that eventually led to the Meiji Restoration. The leaders of the Satsuma domain realized that economic growth—perhaps even Japanese survival—could be achieved only by institutional reforms, but the shogun opposed this because his power was tied to the existing set of institutions. To exact reforms, the shogun had to be overthrown, and he was. The Japanese built their own armament industry. As a consequence of these initial differences, each country responded differently to the challenges of the nineteenth century, with Japan diverging dramatically in the face of the critical juncture created by the Industrial Revolution.""

japindustrialrevolution.19.d:0 ""The last forty samurai seek to avenge their fallen as they make their final gambit, valiantly charging into combat despite the storm of gunfire that threatens to tear them to shreds. A glorious fight for a terrible cause—these fallen soldiers lay waste on the ground, slaughtered ruthlessly by our Gatling guns... 武士道の品格、サムライの最後の砦 (Bushido dignified; the last stand of the Samurai)"\n\nAt Shiroyama hill, Daimyo Samurai Saigō Takamori made his final stand, a beautiful fight waged by the surviving 500 samurai soldiers, all of whom still committed fealty to their commander and code Bushido. Despite starting with roughly 20,000 samurai, Saigō had lost the majority of his soldiers and vital supplies in a succession of prior losses, most notably at Kumamoto Castle and Tabaruzaka Fields. Rikugun-gensui Yamagata Aritomo, an old friend and fellow revolutionary of Saigō during the Meiji Restoration, was his principal opponent. Yamagata gathered his men, numbering in the tens of thousands, to encircle Shiroyama hill with intricate earthworks, trenches, and barricades, ensuring that no samurai could leave and putting an end to the uprising. The Samurai spent their days in preparation for the Imperial soldiers' onslaught. They spent their time at camp singing songs, writing poetry, and playing games. Yamagata appealed to Saigō for unconditional surrender before their terrible deaths.\n\n"As the leader of young vigorous men of the nation and resisting a great and famous army through many fierce battles, your fame is already well enough known to the world. But now most of your brave generals are dead or injured, and your military power is daily growing weaker. It is already clear that at last your Satsuma army is unable to keep its spirit. I don’t know what further things you can hope to achieve, except a hopeless defensive battle. If you, Saigõ, rather than lengthen the rest of your days a little, prefer to cause hundreds and thousands of dead and wounded from both armies, there is nothing that I, Aritomo, can say to you. I beg you to judge for yourself as you hold matters in the palm of your hand, and that you will save both armies from death and injury. Ah, you are a man famous and known in the world. About our national constitution, naturally it is not only Aritomo who knows what you really think. But the matter has been settled over many years of public debate. I, Aritomo, earnestly beg you as your old friend. Writing this my tears fall like rain, and I cannot express myself at all. Please sympathize with the sincerity of my pain.""
japindustrialrevolution.19.a:0 "There's more to the story..."
japindustrialrevolution.20.t:0 "The Story of Shiroyama"
japindustrialrevolution.20.d:0 "...Saigō, true to the code of Bushido, refused to lay down his katana and surrender. \n\nBefore this rebellion, Saigō would never have thought this would be his way out, as he was a simple teacher of the samurai arts. He was content with the fall of the shôgun and the restoration of the Emperor, fighting many battles for the great cause. The changing winds of Japan and the modernization of the country meant the abolition of the privileged social status of the samurai class and the undermining of their financial position. His students stirred up tension between the new westernized government and the samurai class, indirectly involving Saigō in these actions. These very rapid and prodigious changes to Japanese culture, language, dress, and society appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the jōi ("expel the barbarians") portion of the sonnō jōi. With all this forced onto the people of old tradition, tensions boiled and the Satsuma rebellion would begin. \n\n"As the new age begins, the way of the warrior comes to an end; as the new age begins, the ways of old must apprehend." \n\nAfter a search party found Saigō 's body and head, Yamagata Aritomo was alleged to have been left speechless and motionless, murmuring to himself as he looked wearily. \n\n"As Rikugun-gensui Yamagata Aritomo was delivered the head of Saigō  Takamori after learning of his death from Seppuku, the Imperial army marched among the fallen, troops presenting signs of peace for the murdered samurai into the afterlife. I could see the calm expression on his face as he looked down at his dead friend. Many of the troops remained silent as they watched with respect and dignity as he ordered the head to be washed while holding it in his arms and reciting a tranquil meditation to the fallen warrior.""

Long and tense sessions wear him down on a daily basis, and neither the House of Representatives nor the House of Councillors can agree on anything no matter the situation. \n \n"I sit and stand, walk and then pace, talk and then yell, but all of my efforts are for naught since they merely dispute small and indecisively. Few out of many acts have passed within months, a staggeringly low number compared to earlier years. I don't think I'll be able to calm this zoo, and I don't think I'll be able to get anything through this spring." The exhausted minister moans, his gaze falling on the now setting sun, its fiery orange light glooming over the horizon. \n \n... \n \n“Order! Order! Silence your tongues, and let great Shushō Katsura speak, withhold your insolence!” \n \nThe hall becomes silent as footsteps from other chambers echo effortlessly off the marble walls. Katsura is seated on a multi-tiered semicircular platform in front of a central rostrum that divides the chamber. Banners depicting the Hinomaru, or eastern rising sun, hang from the front of the room's ceilings. \n \n'I propose to this great hall… the basis for the Railway Nationalisation Act. . .' \n \n... \n \nThe candlelight glistens on the rough wooden table, which was meticulously carved by only the best for the job. A tiny document sits in the center of the table, and a hand rests near it, grasping a thin, white feather pen dipped in a little cup of black ink solution. Before a name is signed below it, the hand raises the pen from the cup, the ink droplets indicating their way up the page, etching across the document in proper scripting."

JAP_preparation_ministry_of_industry_1_desc:0 "The Ministry of Public Works, better known as Kobu Sho, was established with the intent to achieve social and industrial development within the isles in a short amount of time. The project's deviser and overseer is Edmund Morel, a chief engineer of British origin from the Railway Department. \n \nIt took months of disagreement to get the project in motion, as both sides, Morel and the leading cabinet members, disputed over the overlying purpose of the ministry. Morel intended for it to be the foundation in supporting the development of social and industrial infrastructure—a beacon of transportational advancement; whereas the leading cabinet members wanted a stable engine to drive rapid industrialization, as promised to Emperor Meiji. \n \nIn the end, a compromise was made. The Meiji Government will form the Ministry of Public Works, which will be composed of eleven departments: six principal ones, and the rest to be migrated from the current Ministry of Civil Affairs. The new Ministry of Public Works is to be oriented around industrial development through collaboration with advisors and engineers from around the world."
