#STARTING EVENTS
saxony.1.t:0 "Das Königreich Sachsen –\nAusgangssituation: Innenpolitik"
saxony.1.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] war stark in die revolutionären Aufstände von 1830 und 1848/49 verwickelt. Der öffentliche Druck, der vor allem von Intellektuellen und Akademikern in Leipzig und Dresden ausgeübt wurde, führte 1831 zur Verabschiedung einer relativ fortschrittlichen Verfassung, die das Königreich in eine konstitutionelle Monarchie verwandelte und öffentliche Wahlen für die zweite Kammer des Landtags vorsah.\n\In der Zwischenzeit war das [SAX.GetName] das Land in Deutschland gewesen, welches die raschen Veränderungen hervorgerufen durch die industrielle Revolution am intensivsten erlebte. Vor allem rund um die Städte Chemnitz und Zwickau entstanden zahlreiche hauptsächlich auf die Textil- und Maschinenbauindustrie spezialisierte Fabriken. Damit entwickelte sich auch eine neue soziale Schicht: das Industrieproletariat, das mit den schlechten Arbeitsbedingungen und der fehlenden politischen Vertretung zunehmend unzufrieden wurde.\n\nAufgrund der allgemeinen Unzufriedenheit und der hohen Arbeitslosigkeit war Sachsen eines der Zentren der Märzrevolution von 1848/49. Gewalttätige Ausbrüche zwangen den König, die Regierung mehrfach zu wechseln, fortschrittlichere Minister zu ernennen, die Pressezensur aufzuheben und das Wahlrecht zu liberalisieren. Als die reaktionären Kräfte versuchten, die Kontrolle zurückzuerlangen, kam es zu blutigen Straßenschlachten. Der König löste den Landtag auf und rief preußische Truppen zur Hilfe, die gewalttätig in Dresden eingriffen, wobei es Hunderte von Toten gab. Die kronentreuen Kräfte setzten sich schließlich durch, und die meisten Zugeständnisse wurden zurückgenommen.\n\n[SAX.GetNameDef] befindet sich nun am Scheideweg. Während sich die Aristokraten an ihre Privilegien klammern, fordert die Öffentlichkeit Fortschritt und Liberalisierung, und es stellt sich auch die Frage, wie man mit den wachsenden nationalistischen Gefühlen unter den Sorben umgehen soll. Es wird wichtig sein, ein Gleichgewicht zu finden, unsere Wirtschaft zu entwickeln und sicherzustellen, dass eine weitere Revolte verhindert wird, wenn wir wollen, dass Sachsen blüht und gedeiht."
saxony.1.a:0 "Glück auf, Glück auf, mein Sachsenland!"
saxony.2.t:0 "Das Königreich Sachsen –\nAusgangssituation: Außenpolitik"
saxony.2.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] befindet sich in einer schwierigen geografischen Lage. Eingezwängt zwischen den beiden deutschen Hegemonialmächten Preußen und Österreich und angrenzend an die dritte deutsche Macht, Bayern, im Süden, muss die Regierung vorsichtig vorgehen, insbesondere auf der internationalen Bühne.\n\nWährend die Mitgliedschaft im Zollverein von entscheidender wirtschaftlicher Bedeutung ist, war unser Verhältnis zur führenden Macht des Zollvereins, Preußen, zuletzt nicht das beste. Tatsächlich wäre Sachsen während des Wiener Kongresses 1815 fast vollständig von Preußen annektiert worden, als Strafe dafür, dass es bis zur letzten Minute auf der Seite Napoleons stand.\n\nNur das Eingreifen Österreichs verhinderte damals die vollständige Eingliederung unseres Königreichs in den preußischen Staat, aber wir verloren trotzdem über die Hälfte unseres Territoriums und fast 40 % unserer Bevölkerung als Teil der Schlussakte des Wiener Kongresses. Die Zeiten, in denen wir als europäische Mittelmacht galten, sind vorbei, und es ist uns nur knapp gelungen, die preußische Einigungsinitiative nach der Märzrevolution, die so genannte Erfurter Union, zu verhindern.\n\Nun werden wir entscheiden müssen, wie es weitergehen soll. Wir haben in letzter Zeit einige vielversprechende Fortschritte bei der Zusammenarbeit mit den anderen deutschen Mittelmächten gemacht, und diesen Weg fortzusetzen, dürfte die beste Option sein, auch wenn es schwierig sein könnte, alle Beteiligten auf eine Linie zu bringen. Gleichzeitig sollten wir darauf achten, Österreich und Preußen nicht zu verärgern, sonst könnten unsere Tage als unabhängiges Land gezählt sein..."
saxony.2.a:0 "Gott sei mit dir, mein Sachsenland!"

###POLITICAL AND WAR EVENTS
#DOMESTIC POLITICS
saxony.201.t:0 "Ferdinand von Zschinsky unheilbar erkrankt - Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust zum kommissarischen Ministerpräsidenten ernannt"
saxony.201.d:0 "Ministerpräsident von Zschinsky befand sich bereits seit etwa zwei Jahren in einem schlechten Gesundheitszustand, als er Anfang dieses Jahres auf Wunsch von König Johann einen Erholungsurlaub in Südfrankreich und Italien antrat. Nach Angaben der Ärzte leidet der Ministerpräsident an einem chronischen Lungenleiden, das nur durch einen Klimawechsel geheilt werden kann. Die Reise brachte jedoch keine wesentliche Verbesserung seines Gesundheitszustandes, und von Zschinsky kehrte vor drei Wochen nach Dresden zurück. Heute erreichte König und Parlament eine traurige Nachricht: von Zschinsky ist schwer erkrankt und kann sein Ministeramt auf absehbare Zeit nicht mehr ausüben. Der behandelnde Arzt von Zschinskys hat keinen Hehl aus seinen Zweifeln gemacht, ob der Ministerpräsident überhaupt wieder gesund wird... Seine Majestät, König Johann, hat bereits von Zschinskys langjährigen politischen Gegner, Außenminister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust, zum kommissarischen Ministerpräsidenten ernannt. Von Beust ist für seine liberal-konservative Agenda bekannt und will Sachsen wieder auf die diplomatische Landkarte Europas setzen. Von Zschinskys sich verschlechternder Gesundheitszustand könnte einen bedeutenden Wandel in der sächsischen Politik eingeleitet haben."
saxony.201.a:0 "Von Zschinskys Tage scheinen gezählt zu sein..."
saxony.202.t:0 "Tod von Ferdinand von Zschinsky"
saxony.202.d:0 "Nach mehrtägigem Todeskampf ist Ministerpräsident Ferdinand von Zschinsky heute Morgen verstorben. Seine zehnjährige Regierungszeit als Chef des Innenministeriums und schließlich als Ministerpräsident machte von Zschinsky zu einer bekannten Persönlichkeit nicht nur in der sächsischen, sondern auch in der deutschen Politik. Sein juristisches Können verschaffte ihm auch den Respekt seiner Kollegen und Gesetzgeber in ganz Europa. Der Träger des Großkreuzes des Sächsischen Zivilverdienstordens, des kaiserlich-österreichischen Ordens der Eisernen Krone und des kaiserlich-russischen St.-Anna-Ordens wird uns sehr fehlen und ein ehrenvolles Begräbnis erhalten."
saxony.202.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
saxony.203.t:0 "Tod von Ferdinand Lassalle"
saxony.203.d:0 "Wir erhalten mehrere Berichte, die unabhängig voneinander den Tod von Ferdinand Lassalle bestätigen. Als überzeugter Sozialist und Monarchist zugleich war Lassalle ein ideologisch widersprüchlicher Mann. Er unterhielt Beziehungen sowohl zu Erzkommunisten wie Karl Marx als auch zu einem Erzmonarchisten wie Otto von Bismarck. Auch wenn manche behaupten, Lassalle sei ein Revolutionär gewesen, so war er doch letztlich im Herzen Nationalist, der bereit war, sich auf jede gesellschaftliche Ideologie einzulassen, um das Ziel eines geeinten Deutschlands zu erreichen. Sein früher Tod wird sicherlich ein schwerer Schlag für den gemäßigten Sozialismus in Deutschland sein, denn die Bewegung verliert ihren brillantesten Denker."
saxony.203.a:0 "Ruhe in Frieden."
saxony.204.t:0 "Die Sorbische Frage"
saxony.204.d:0 "Die Sorben sind eine westslawische Volksgruppe, die überwiegend in der Lausitz, dem nordwestlichen Teil unseres Reiches, lebt. Infolge des Wiener Kongresses von 1815 wurde ein großer Teil der sorbischen Gebiete vom [PRS.GetName] beschlagnahmt, aber es leben immer noch etwa 65.000 Sorben im [SAX.GetName]. Der sorbische Nationalismus ist in letzter Zeit auf dem Vormarsch, vor allem im Zusammenhang mit der Märzrevolution von 1848/49, und viele sorbische Intellektuelle hegen panslawistische Ansichten und unterhalten Verbindungen zu anderen slawischen Intellektuellen im Osten. Die jüngsten Entwicklungen sind zunehmend besorgniserregend, und wir müssen jetzt entscheiden, wie es in der sorbischen Frage weitergehen soll."
saxony.204.a:0 "Wir müssen diese Bekundungen ihrer Identität akzeptieren."
saxony.204.b:0 "Wir werden die Angelegenheit weiterhin grundsätzlich ignorieren."
saxony.204.c:0 "Wir müssen sie um jeden Preis assimilieren!"
saxony.205.t:0 "Die Entstehung der sorbischen Schriftsprache"
saxony.205.d:0 "Die Sorben, eine westslawische ethnische Minderheit, die hauptsächlich in der Lausitz beheimatet ist, haben sich jahrhundertelang hauptsächlich mündlich verständigt und ihre Traditionen und Geschichte oral weitergegeben. Zwar gab es schon früher schriftliche Formen der sorbischen Dialekte, doch waren diese sehr uneinheitlich und die gegenseitige Verständlichkeit war kaum gegeben. Seit einigen Jahrzehnten bemühen sich sorbische Intellektuelle um eine fixe Grammatik, ein Regelwerk, das die sorbische Sprache und ihre Dialekte regelt. Das hat den sorbischen Nationalismus und das sorbische Selbstbewusstsein gestärkt, und wir können in Zukunft mit deutlich mehr sorbischen literarischen, historiographischen und sprachwissenschaftlichen Veröffentlichungen rechnen."
saxony.205.a:0 "Nun, schön für sie."
saxony.206.t:0 "Zehnjähriges Bestehen der Maćica Serbska"
saxony.206.d:0 "Die sogenannte Maćica Serbska ist eine einflussreiche sorbische wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft. Gegründet 1847 in der Lausitzer Stadt Bautzen, fanden und finden viele sorbische Intellektuelle wie Handrij Zejler (Bild) und Jan Arnošt Smoler in der Maćica Serbska Inspiration und eine gemeinsame Sache bei der Förderung der sorbischen Kultur. Die Gesellschaft hat eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Etablierung einer sorbischen Grammatik und Literatur gespielt und wird wohl auch weiterhin als Keimzelle der sorbischen Identität fungieren."
saxony.206.a:0 "Wir müssen das im Auge behalten."
saxony.207.t:0 "Serbske Nowiny - Sorbische Zeitschrift"
saxony.207.d:0 "Die erste sorbische Zeitschrift wurde 1842 von Handrij Zejler gegründet, der später von Jan Arnošt Smoler unterstützt wurde. Im Jahr 1854 wurde die Zeitschrift in "Serbske Nowiny" - Sorbische Zeitung - umbenannt, und die Auflage hat sich seither stark gesteigert. Vor allem unter den protestantischen Sorben übt sie einen großen Einfluss aus, und wir müssen die Aktivitäten der Verleger genau beobachten. Unsere Vorgänger haben der Zeitung bereits verboten, Nachrichten über auswärtige Angelegenheiten abzudrucken, und wir werden dies auch weiterhin tun."
saxony.207.a:0 "Wir müssen die Kontrolle behalten."
saxony.208.t:0 "Neues Lausitzisches Magazin - 40. Jahrestag"
saxony.208.d:0 "Das 'Neue Lausitzische Magazin' ist das Publikationsorgan der Oberlausitzischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, einer Gelehrtengesellschaft mit Sitz in Görlitz. Obwohl die Gesellschaft und ihre Zeitschrift nicht spezifisch sorbischen Nationalismus und sorbische Identität agitieren, bietet sie vielen sorbischen Intellektuellen eine Plattform, und ihre Publikationen finden beim liberal-progressiven Bürgertum in Sachsen und Preußen Anklang. Hoffen wir, dass die wissenschaftlichen Vorteile die Gefahren überwiegen, die von einigen dieser Dissidenten ausgehen."
saxony.208.a:0 "Gar nicht mehr so neu, oder?"
saxony.209.t:0 "Gründung des Katolski Posoł - Katholische Sorbische Zeitschrift"
saxony.209.d:0 "Der kürzlich von Michał Hórnik gegründete Katolski Posoł - Katholischer Herold - ist eine sorbische Zeitschrift, die sich speziell an katholische Sorben richtet. Die Zeitschrift hat zwar einen religiösen Charakter, könnte aber auch dazu benutzt werden, heimlich sorbische separatistische Tendenzen zu schüren. Wir sollten ein Auge auf ihre Veröffentlichungen haben."
saxony.209.a:0 "Katholische Sorbische könnten auch gefährlich sein..."
saxony.210.t:0 "Slawisches Zentralblatt - eine Wochenzeitschrift mit panslawistischen Tendenzen"
saxony.210.d:0 "Jan Arnošt Smoler hat kürzlich eine weitere sorbische Zeitschrift gegründet, das 'Slawische Zentralblatt', das in deutscher Sprache erscheint. Der Untertitel lautet 'für Literatur, Kunst, Wissenschaft und nationale Interessen des Gesamtslawentums'. Smoler bemüht sich also erst gar nicht, die panslawistischen Tendenzen dieser Publikation zu kaschieren, und wir werden dafür sorgen müssen, ihre Verbreitung zu begrenzen und zu behindern."
saxony.210.a:0 "Sorbische Intellektuelle, die Russland die Hand reichen, alarmierend..."
saxony.211.t:0 "Lausitzisch-Niedersorbisches Wörterbuch veröffentlicht"
saxony.211.d:0 "Die sorbische Minderheit unterscheidet sich sprachlich stark von ihren deutschen Nachbarn, was die gegenseitige Verständigung erschwert. Für die sorbische Sprache, die in Deutschland gemeinhin als 'Wendisch' bezeichnet wird, gibt es jetzt ein Wörterbuch, das die Übersetzung ins Deutsche und umgekehrt für Menschen mit nur geringen Kenntnissen beider Sprachen erheblich erleichtert. Auch wenn die Verwendung dieses Wörterbuchs die Bedeutung und den Stellenwert der wendischen Sprache praktisch aufwertet, so ist es doch eine gute Gelegenheit zur gegenseitigen Annäherung."
saxony.211.a:0 "Zumindest können wir uns jetzt gegenseitig verstehen."
saxony.212.t:0 "Zweiter Panslawistischer Kongress in Wien"
saxony.212.d:0 "Eine sorbische Delegation hat am Zweiten Panslawischen Kongress in Wien Anfang des Jahres teilgenommen. Nach dem ersten Panslawischen Kongress in Prag im Jahr 1847 erreichte die nationalistische und separatistische Agitation unter den Slawen in ganz Osteuropa, einschließlich dem [SAX.GetName], einen Siedepunkt. Wir müssen sehr vorsichtig sein, damit diese Aufständischen nicht wieder Unruhe stiften. Vielleicht müssen wir unsere Geheimdienste verstärken, um mit ihnen fertig zu werden."
saxony.212.a:0 "Diese panslawistischen Agitatoren müssen gestoppt werden."

#FOREIGN POLITICS AND WAR EVENTS
saxony.301.t:0 "Die preußisch-sächsischen Beziehungen - Status Quo"
saxony.301.d:0 "Unsere Beziehungen zu Preußen waren und sind, gelinde gesagt, schwierig. Zunächst Verbündete während der Reformationszeit und gegen Österreich im späten 18. Jahrhundert, kämpften sie im Bayerischen Erbfolgekrieg, in dem Sachsen später zwischen den beiden Großmächten in Deutschland vermittelte. Aber gleichzeitig wuchs Preußen immer mehr in die Rolle unseres Hauptfeindes hinein, da es für uns zu einer Gefahr wurde, weil es sein Militär verstärkte.\n\nSeit den 1740er Jahren verschlechterte sich unser Verhältnis immer mehr, aber als die Französische Revolution kam und König Ludwig abgesetzt (und später hingerichtet) wurde, erklärten sich Preußen und Sachsen bereit, auf der Seite des französischen Königs gegen die Republikaner zu kämpfen. Dieses Bündnis bestand bis 1806, als Napoleon Sachsen besetzte und wir auf seine Seite überliefen. Obwohl wir recht gut kämpften und viel Territorium gewannen, wurde das Bündnis mit der Niederlage Napoleons im Jahr 1815 aufgelöst. \n\nObwohl wir 1815 die Hälfte unseres Territoriums und unserer Bevölkerung an Preußen verloren, konnten wir unsere Unabhängigkeit bewahren, da Preußen daran gehindert wurde, uns zu annektieren. Unsere gegenseitigen Beziehungen waren seit 1815 solide. Da wir beide Teil des Deutschen Bundes und des Zollvereins sind, müssen wir zusammenarbeiten, um Deutschland als Ganzes voranzubringen. In den revolutionären Wirren von 1849 hat Preußen die Revolutionäre zurückgedrängt, da wir selbst dazu nicht in der Lage waren. \n\nWir haben also einen Verbündeten, der schnell zum Feind werden kann - kurzum ein schwieriges Verhältnis. Wie sollten wir mit Preußen verfahren?"
saxony.301.a:0 "Preußen ist nicht unser Verbündeter und wird es auch niemals sein."
SAX_PRS_relation_bad_effect_tt:0 "§RWir werden einen Weg der Opposition gegenüber Preußen verfolgen.§!"
saxony.301.b:0 "Wir müssen uns versöhnen."
SAX_PRS_relation_good_effect_tt:0 "§GWir werden einen Weg der Annäherung an Preußen verfolgen.§!"
saxony.302.t:0 "Die österreichisch-sächsischen Beziehungen - Status Quo"
saxony.302.d:0 "Als Verbündete seit den Tagen des alten Heiligen Römischen Reiches, als die Habsburger den Titel des Heiligen Römischen Kaisers übernommen hatten, unterhielten das Kurfürstentum Sachsen und Österreich bis zur Zeit der Reformation solide Beziehungen. Als unsere Bevölkerung zum Luthertum übertrat, zogen es die Österreicher vor, katholisch zu bleiben, was natürlich zu Spannungen im Reich führte. Während des Dreißigjährigen Krieges war Sachsen zunächst mit den Österreichern verbündet, musste aber später die Seiten wechseln, da Schweden bereits einen großen Teil Sachsens besetzt hatte.\n\nDer Westfälische Friede brachte Sachsen einige Gebietsgewinne und beendete den Krieg mit Österreich. Von da an unterhielten Sachsen und Österreich eine neutrale Beziehung. Wir halfen den Österreichern, als Wien 1683 von den Türken umzingelt wurde, und kämpften im folgenden Krieg gegen die Osmanen. \n\nNachdem 100 Jahre lang Frieden geherrscht hatte, musste Sachsen in den Bayerischen Erbfolgekrieg eingreifen und gegen Österreich kämpfen, bevor es zwischen Preußen und Österreich vermitteln konnte. In den Napoleonischen Kriegen kämpfte Sachsen dann zunächst auf der Seite Österreichs, bis es sich 1806 Napoleons 'Rheinbund' anschließen musste. Danach kämpfte Sachsen gegen Österreich, bis man an der Seite Napoleons 1813 die Völkerschlacht verlor. Österreich war auch der Grund dafür, dass wir nach dem Wiener Kongress, auf dem Preußen unser gesamtes Territorium ursprünglich annektieren wollte, unabhängig bleiben konnten. \n\nDurch die Zusammenarbeit im Deutschen Bund haben Sachsen und Österreich ein freundschaftliches Verhältnis aufgebaut und ihren Willen zur Zusammenarbeit zum Ausdruck gebracht, wie im 'Wiener Münzvertrag'. Österreich ist ein wichtiger Partner in unserer Außenpolitik, da es uns in militärischen Angelegenheiten, insbesondere gegen Preußen, unterstützt.\n\nUnsere Beziehung zu Österreich mag früher Tiefpunkte gehabt haben, aber wir haben jetzt definitiv eine bessere Beziehung aufgebaut. Wie wollen wir also jetzt, in diesen schwierigen Zeiten, mit Österreich umgehen?"
saxony.302.a:0 "Wir haben ein freundschaftliches Verhältnis zu Österreich und werden versuchen, es zu intensivieren."
SAX_AUS_relation_good_effect_tt:0 "§RWir werden einen Weg der freundschaftlichen Beziehungen zu Österreich verfolgen.§!"
saxony.302.b:0 "Wir müssen so unparteiisch wie möglich sein."
SAX_AUS_relation_neutral_effect_tt:0 "§GWir werden einen Weg der Neutralität gegenüber Österreich verfolgen.§!"
saxony.303.t:0 "[SAX.GetNameDef] schlägt Bemühung um Bundesreform vor"
saxony.303.d:0 "Die Sachsen haben ihre Absicht bekundet, den Deutschen Bund zu reformieren und einen Teil der Macht an den Deutschen Bundestag zu verlagern. Das sächsische Außenministerium hat seine Idee vorgestellt, einen judikativen Zweig im Deutschen Bund einzurichten, der für ganz Deutschland zuständig sein soll. Diese Ideen könnten zu einer Zentralisierung des Deutschen Bundes führen. Sollten wir die Idee Sachsens unterstützen?"
saxony.303.a:0 "Geben Sie ihnen positives Feedback."
SAX_bundesreform_event_positive_effect_tt:0 "Dies wird die sächsische Regierung in ihrem Reformvorhaben bestärken."
saxony.303.b:0 "Sagen Sie ihnen, dass wir interessiert sind, aber geben Sie keine Versprechen ab."

saxony.306.a:0 "Wie schade!"
saxony.307.t:0 "Sächsische Einladung zu einer Trias-Konferenz"
saxony.307.d:0 "[SAX.GetNameDef] hat uns zu einer Versammlung der deutschen Mittelstaaten, der sogenannten Trias, nach Würzburg eingeladen. Die Sachsen sind in letzter Zeit diplomatisch sehr aktiv und versuchen, auf dem gegenseitigen Verständnis der kleineren deutschen Mächte auf der Bamberger Konferenz von 1854 aufzubauen. Sie halten an ihrer Behauptung fest, dass der einzige Weg zur Erhaltung der Unabhängigkeit und des Friedens für die deutschen Mittelmächte in einer viel engeren Zusammenarbeit besteht. Wie werden wir auf ihre Einladung reagieren?"
saxony.307.a:0 "Wir werden an der Konferenz teilnehmen."
saxony.307.b:0 "Wir werden nicht an der Konferenz teilnehmen."
saxony.308.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] nimmt die Einladung an"
saxony.308.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] hat unsere Einladung zur Würzburger Konferenz angenommen, auf der unser Außenminister von Beust seinen Plan zur Reform des Deutschen Bundes vorstellen wird. Das beweist, dass das [FROM.GetName] uns bei unserem Vorhaben unterstützen will und sich auch gegen den aktuellen Status quo ausspricht!"
saxony.308.a:0 "Sehr gut!"
saxony.309.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] lehnt die Einladung ab"
saxony.309.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] hat unsere Einladung zur Teilnahme an der Würzburger Konferenz, auf der unser Außenminister von Beust seinen Plan zur Reform des Deutschen Bundes vorstellen wird, abgelehnt. Das zeigt nur, dass das [FROM.GetName] nicht bereit ist, den nächsten Schritt zu gehen und die Freiheit Deutschlands lieber unter den Stiefeln Preußens und Österreichs zertrampelt sehen möchte!"
saxony.309.a:0 "Schande!"

SAX_focus_gewandhaus_leipzig_desc:0 "The Gewandhaus was at first a place, where military equipment was built and repaired, when it was first opened in 1498. Around the mid of the 18th Century however, it became the home of a orchestra and concerts were played regularly. Renovated in 1833 and 1842, more people than ever can get to see one of our great orchestras playing there. This surely is a great sign for the Saxon musical scene and culture!"

With it's appearance, that is described as one of the most beautiful in Europe by some, it is a great sign for the Saxon culture! This prestigious project shows how proud we are of our culture and how much we are ready to invest for it!"
SAX_focus_religion_and_education:0 "Religion and Education"
SAX_focus_religion_and_education_desc:0 "A part of our cultural heritage is history with our protestant religion, which started all the way back with Martin Luther residing in Saxony. From here, he translated the bible into German, which allowed the ordinary people to become independent from the interpretation from the Catholic Church. Some time after that, Christians that believed in Luthers ideas split up from the Catholic Church, and established their protestant one. As the formerly strongest protestant state we did everything to defend our religion, but since then, a long time passed. Earlier we have teached our religious values in schools, but perhaps it is time to take a look at religion and it's role in education?"
SAX_focus_secularize_secondary_education:0 "Secularize Secondary Education"
SAX_focus_secularize_secondary_education_desc:0 "A possible reform for our education would be to secularize our secondary education, which would allow us to teach our students more important things that will be needed in future, and not to teach them something they have learned during their earlier years at school. It would also make schools independent from the church supervisors, which are still used by the church. We would undoubtedly profit from such a reform!"

SAX_focus_political_realities_desc:0 "We may have a politically interested king, but we still live in difficult times. Ever since 1830, our citizens forced us to establish democratic structures into our monarchist system we had for a long time. Whilst introducing a parliament and a constitution was enough to satisfy our citizens by 1831, they rebelled again in 1848, demanding that Saxony should become part of a united Germany, and later, that a Saxon Republic should be established! At the height of the revolution we were only saved by Prussia. A disaster! We need to overthink our political strategy, if we want to prevent another situation like in 1848 occuring again."

SAX_focus_universal_male_franchise:0 "Universal Male Franchise"
SAX_focus_universal_male_franchise_desc:0 "As part of our reforms, we will have to take a look at our election system. The current system shows that either the King can decide on his deputies in the parliament, or they were just part of it, because of their position. The average Saxon doesn't get to decide on his rulers, and that needs to change immediatly! By introducing a universal male franchise, we would ensure that every male Saxon is able to vote for his parliament, like he could in 1848 and 1849, before the counter-revolutionaries abolished the law again!"

Living in eastern Saxony even before the Germans arrived, they were subjugated by the Saxon rulers over the centuries, even if they belong to Saxony like Saxons do. We should abolish these discriminatory laws introduced a long time ago, and instead pass new laws that grant Sorbs full equality in our country, as they should have."
SAX_focus_moderate_reforms:0 "Moderate Reforms"
SAX_focus_moderate_reforms_desc:0 "Whilst we should reform Saxony, maybe we should try to find a compromise with the other parties participating in such discussions, as that would ensure us no trouble with any of the others in parliament, or outside of it.

SAX_focus_adapt_sufferage_law_desc:0 "We should seek to change the suffrage law in that regard, that we allow more men, who are over 25 and pay taxes to the state should be allowed to vote for the second chamber of the parliament.

SAX_focus_end_press_censorship:0 "End Press and Association Censorship"
SAX_focus_end_press_censorship_desc:0 "Introduced in 1819, our Press censorship should prevent the newspapers and their associations to write articles about any ideas that were contrary to the one of the restauration after the Congress of Vienna. During the 1830 and 1848/49 revolutions, this censorship proved itself very insufficient, and thus, it only hinders people to tell their opinion officially in newspapers, even if they can do it at gatherings. We should seek to abolish this law."

SAX_focus_conserve_the_status_quo_desc:0 "Instead of giving in to the liberals, who didn't stop after we granted them reforms in 1830 and 1848, but instead tried to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic, we should seek to maintain stability instead of trying to reform us once again. We should keep the Status Quo, because this system has proven itself to be successful in comparison to short-lived revolutionary states."

SAX_focus_revoke_1849_consessions_desc:0 "The concessions we made to the insurgents in 1849 were made so that the protestors could calm down and deaccelarate themselves in their plan to overthrow the monarchy. After the Prussian troops saved our King, it was only a matter of time, when we will revoke the concessions of 1849.

SAX_focus_revoke_1831_constitution_desc:0 "The Constitution Saxony gave itself in 1831 established democratic structures into Saxony via the introduction of the parliament, and his two cabinets, and whilst it helped to calm down the citizens back then it also ended the absolute monarchy that was ruling in Saxony until then. A big disaster! But with our rule now consolified, we have the opportunity to reverse this horrible decision that was taken back then and to restore the ruler to his throne and he will be allowed to reign without any interference. Or - in other words - he will rule absolute again!"

SAX_focus_toughen_press_censorship:0 "Toughen Press and Association Censorship"
SAX_focus_toughen_press_censorship_desc:0 "In 1819, we decided to implement a law that allowed us to censor the press, so that our goal of restoration after the Congress of Vienna can be achieved without nationalists interfering and wanting to form a German state. As seen in 1830 and 1848, those laws were not harsh enough, so we need to toughen them! If not, our goal may be endangered. Perhaps we could use this danger as a excuse to exclude newspapers that are overly democratic or liberal, so that our monarchist position will be strenghthened too!"

SAX_focus_buy_austrian_rifles:0 "Buy Austrian Rifles"
SAX_focus_buy_austrian_rifles_desc:0 "Austria is a great partner for us and at the same time of our fiercest allies.

SAX_focus_buy_prussian_cannons:0 "Buy Prussian Cannons"
SAX_focus_buy_prussian_cannons_desc:0 "Although we share a troubled history with our northern neighbour, they managed to improve and reform their army continusly, which elevated them into the status of a Great Power in Europe, whilst our army and state were on the decline since 1815.

SAX_focus_convention_with_prussia_desc:0 "Our relations may not be the best ones. And our past may be troublesome. But at the same time, Prussia has improved their army since Bismarck became Prussia's Prime Minister and probably exceeds Austria's military capacities already. Allying with Prussia would also be good from our strategic point of view, as Austrian reinforcements would only arrive after we would have lost a majority of our territory against Prussia. Although we would definetly lose our claim to our former territory of northern Saxony, allying with Prussia could allow us to stay independent, whilst allying with Austria could mean the end of Saxony as a independent state. It may hurt, but signing a military convention with Prussia is the best option we have."

SAX_focus_convention_with_the_trias_desc:0 "In accordance to our policies during the last years we should sign a military convention with the Trias, the other German states, that do not want to pick a side. With signing this convention we have a huge chance that neither of the great powers could invade us, even if we have a direct route to Berlin or Prague, as neither Prussia nor Austria wants to have a united Trias no fight side on side with their enemy in case of war. We could secure our safety and security with that move, even if the Trias is not stronger than Prussia or Austria alone."
SAX_focus_convention_with_austria:0 "...with Austria"
SAX_focus_convention_with_austria_desc:0 "The reason why we should pick Austria as our partner are simple. Not only do they want to keep us independent, unlike Prussia did at several occasions, like in 1815, where they wished to outright annex us! But Austria is also a good partner for us for a long time and it is a bigger country than Prussia with a stronger army.

To circumvent a issue by Thuringia cutting off the railway line, we have decided in 1845 to build another line between Chemnitz, an important industrial center of Saxony, and Bavaria. Whilst we already have opened the part starting from Zwickau to Bavaria, we have not been able to complete the Chemnitz-Zwickau railway, until now.

One of these connections would be between Chemnitz and the Ore Mountains, which also is the border between Saxony and our southern partner Austria. Building this railway line could help us in two regards, first it allows us, or the industry in Saxony, to import lignite from the North Bohemian Basin in northwestern Bohemia. The second reason for building a railway is, that our partners from Austria could defend us in a, albeit unlikely, war against Prussia."

SAX_idea_anti_prussian_sentiments:0 "Anti Prussian Sentiments"
SAX_idea_anti_prussian_sentiments_desc:0 "Just over 40 years ago, Prussia stripped away 60% of Saxon territory as a result of the Congress of Vienna. Prussia was barely stopped from annexing the entire nation, it is clear they have little regard for the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Saxony. The Napoleonic Wars brought Prussia back to the table of the European great powers, and their ambition to unite all German states is most threatening to Saxon independence."
SAX_idea_land_owners_prevalence_1:0 "Land Owners Prevalence"
SAX_idea_land_owners_prevalence_1_desc:0 "Our current suffrage legislation favors land owners and aristocrats. The dominance of these old elites hampers our ability to develop our industry and makes it harder to open our country for foreign ideas, businesses and capital."

SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1:0 "Sorbian Tensions"
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_1_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. For centuries, Saxons have forcibly assimilated Sorbs through a destruction of Sorbian culture, literature, and language. Recently, the Sorbs have become more boisterous, thousands of them call for an end to the assimilation, and the tensions now risk boiling over."
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_2:0 "Sorbian Minority"
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_2_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. The Sorbian national culture is currently enjoying its heyday in poetry, music, literature, and language. Nevertheless, the way of mutual recognition will probably ease tensions and assist in their peaceful assimilation in the long run."
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_3:0 "Forced Sorbian Assimilation"
SAX_idea_ethnic_tensions_3_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. The Sorbian national culture is currently enjoying its heyday in poetry, music, literature, and language. We must crash their separatist tendencies and force them to assimilate!"

SAX_idea_royal_society_for_sciences_1_desc:0 "Supporting the Royal Saxon Society for the Sciences, we could help the university to teach more students, which in turn will have the knowledge in their sector, for example to work in our industrial sector and perhaps to revolutionise industry once again.

#Country Leader Descriptions
SAX_FERDINAND_VON_ZSCHINSKY_LEADER_DESC:0 "Having studied and worked as a lawyer in the private, public, and aristocratic spheres, Ferdinand von Zschinsky served a two-week stint as the head of Saxony's Ministry of the Interior in 1848 before being appointed leader of the Saxon government by King Friedrich August II in 1849, an honour that eventually earned him an aristocratic title in 1856.\n\nZschinsky's leadership has been ideologically mixed: one of his government's first actions was the dissolution of the Saxon State Parliament and the reinstatement of the less liberal 1831 constitution (a major reversal of concessions made in the wake of the 1848 revolutions), but on the other hand he has also stripped feudal landlords of their legal jurisdiction and separated the powers of the state and judiciary.\n\nWhile his time in office has been consequential for Saxony, Ferdinand von Zschinsky is in ailing health, and he likely does not have much more time to lead."
