 eoanb_bulgaria.10.d: "Girdap's constituent assembly was held on 1 December 1881, less than four years after the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule and the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria. Ruse prospered due to its role as a major port on the Danube, its rapid industrial development and its well-established ties with Central Europe along that river. Banking, however, was a new concept, as most people employed the services of money lenders and entrusted their savings to people they knew personally. The founders of Girdap sought to \"liberate the population of money lenders\", in the words of later bank director Boncho Boev. Due to an overall lack of capital in the country, interest rates of loans given by Girdap were nonetheless high: 15-18% as compared to the over 20-30% interest rate of money lenders. The bank officially commenced operations on 1 January 1882. It took its name from the Girdap neighbourhood of Ruse where the constituent assembly was held."

 eoanb_bulgaria.16.t: "The Pretenders to the Bulgarian Throne"
 eoanb_bulgaria.16.d: "The intrigues surrounding the candidate for the Bulgarian throne began at the Berlin Congress itself. Subsequently, the Russian Emperor Alexander II imposed an additional condition, according to which no Russian subject could be elected as a Bulgarian prince. Among the first candidates were King Milan of Serbia and Prince Carol of Romania. The names of Prince Hermann Reuss-Köstritz, Prince Emmanuel Bogoridi, Prince Bibesko and some others were also put forward, but some of these were put forward to show that the Bulgarians were supposedly not unanimous in their preferences beforehand, while others were fictitious names that appeared in the press and were unlikely to be elected. Although his name was mentioned among the candidates, Prince Royce also did not accept to take part in the contest, since the newly adopted Bulgarian constitution required that the successor of the first Bulgarian prince should be of the Orthodox faith. At the last moment, England put forward Prince Waldemar of Denmark as a contender, but he was unknown in Bulgaria and there was no time to propagandize him accordingly. The Bulgarians liked two figures who had done a great service to the country: Count Nikolai Ignatiev and Prince Alexander Dondukov-Korsakov. But they were Russian subjects and could not participate in the race. After the Russian government officially declared this, the candidacy of Prince Alexander Battenberg began to gain real chances for the Bulgarian throne.As the time approached when the election of the Bulgarian prince was to take place, the name of Prince Alexander Battenberg became more and more popular. He was the nephew and favourite of the Russian Tsarina Maria Alexandrova and took a direct part in the Russo-Turkish War. Bulgarian voters no doubt took it as a consideration that, given his kinship with three of the ruling families of Europe, the election of Battenberg would face fewer obstacles from the great powers than any other candidate. Besides, she was not officially nominated by the Russian government, and the Bulgarians were told that they would not be pressed in their choice. It was not concealed, however, that it would give pleasure to the highest personages in Russia to have Prince Alexander Battenberg elected Prince of Bulgaria."
 eoanb_bulgaria.16.a: "Battenberg is the best choice"

 eoanb_bulgaria.17.t: "Battenberg's European Tour"
 eoanb_bulgaria.17.d: "From the interview of the politicians in Europe it appeared that the Bulgarian prince undertook his journey actuated by a sense of international propriety which prompted him to thank personally the rulers of the states which had approved his election. To the western capitals he set out to do just that. On the way back he intended to spend a few days with his family and then to go to Constantinople - to receive the berat, i.e. investiture, from the Sultan, and thence to proceed directly by sea to Bulgaria, landing at Varna.\n\nFrom Livadia Alexander Battenberg set out for Odessa, where he arrived on 18 May. He was met by the local governor-general, Adjutant-General Edward Totleben. Having inspected his 13th Battalion, he departed the same day for Vienna, where he arrived on 20 May. There the prince he spent several days. On 21 May he was received with great honour by Franz Joseph. The audience lasted a quarter of an hour, at which the Bulgarian monarch appeared in Russian general's uniform. He saw Count Andrassy several times and had long talks with him.\n\nPrince Alexander I remained in Vienna until the 23rd of May, when he went to Berlin by way of Dresden to present himself to the Emperor Wilhelm. According to the newspaper reports, talking to Bismarck, he expressed his concern about the fate that awaited him in Bulgaria, to which the Iron Chancellor allegedly objected: 'Never mind, go! In the German capital the prince formed his retinue, which included three Germans.\n\nFrom Berlin on May 30 he went to Paris, where he met the President of the French Republic. On 5 June he left for London and the summer residence of the royal family, Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. From England he went to Darmstadt, where he spent 10 days with his family and then travelled to Rome, where he arrived on 19 June. He also stayed there for a few days, receiving a most cordial reception from King Umberto. Alexander Battenberg was next to continue his journey to Constantinople, making the sea voyage on the Russian steamer Constantine already mentioned. Arrived in Constantinople on 5 July, Battenberg stayed there only a few hours."

The decision for the Chetnik Action was taken at the 1st Macedonian Congress in March 1895 in Sofia, which established the Macedonian Organization, headed by the Macedonian Committee. The action was organized and carried out with the knowledge of the government of Konstantin Stoilov and Prince Ferdinand I, as the Committee intended to exploit the deteriorated image of the Ottoman Empire in Europe after the Armenian massacres. The future of the rebels depends on us. Whether we help them or leave them to their fate."

 eoanb_bulgaria.27.t: "Alexander II Osvoboditel assassinated"
 eoanb_bulgaria.27.d: "The Tsar travelled both to and from the Manège in a closed two-seater carriage drawn by a pair of horses. He was accompanied by five mounted Cossacks and Frank (Franciszek) Joseph Jackowski, a Polish noble, with a sixth Cossack sitting on the coachman's left. The emperor's carriage was followed by three sleighs carrying, among others, the chief of police Colonel Dvorzhitzky and two officers of the Gendarmerie. At 2:15 PM, the carriage had gone about 150 yards down the quay until it encountered Rysakov who was carrying a bomb wrapped in a handkerchief. On the signal being given by Perovskaya, Rysakov threw the bomb under the Tsar's carriage. The Cossack who rode behind was mortally wounded and died shortly that day. Among those injured was a fourteen year old peasant boy who served as a delivery boy in a butcher's shop. However, the explosion had only damaged the bulletproof carriage. The emperor emerged shaken but unhurt. Rysakov was captured almost immediately. Police Chief Dvorzhitsky heard Rysakov shout out to someone else in the gathering crowd. The coachman implored the Emperor not to alight. Dvorzhitzky offered to drive the Tsar back to the Palace in his sleigh. The Tsar agreed, but he decided to first see the culprit, and to survey the damage. He expressed solicitude for the victims. To the anxious inquires of his entourage, Alexander replied, "Thank God, I'm untouched". He was ready to drive away when a second bomber, Hryniewiecki, who had come close to the Tsar, made a sudden movement, throwing a bomb at his feet. A second explosion ripped through the air and the Emperor and his assassin fell to the ground, both mortally injured. Since people had crowded close to the Tsar, Hryniewiecki's bomb claimed more injuries than the first. Alexander was leaning on his right arm. His legs were shattered below the knee from which he was bleeding profusely, his abdomen was torn open, and his face was mutilated. Hryniewiecki himself, also gravely wounded from the blast, lay next to the Tsar and the butcher's boy. Ivan Yemelyanov, the third bomber in the crowd, stood ready, clutching a briefcase containing a bomb that would be used if the other two bombers failed. However, he instead along with other bystanders rushed to answer the Tsar's barely audible cries for help; he could barely whisper "Take me to the palace... there... I will die." Alexander was carried by sleigh to his study in the Winter Palace, where almost the same day twenty years earlier, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. Members of the Romanov family came rushing to the scene. The dying emperor was given Communion and Last rites. When the attending physician, Sergey Botkin, was asked how long it would be, he replied, "Up to fifteen minutes." At 3:30 that day, the personal flag of Alexander II was lowered for the last time."
 eoanb_bulgaria.27.a: "May he rest in peace"

 eoanb_bulgaria.28.t: "The 1881 Coup"
 eoanb_bulgaria.28.d: "Under the government of Karavelov, the rift between Prince Battenberg and the government in terms of domestic policy deepened. After a few months of rule, a number of necessary state institutions had still not been established, and inter-party squabbles made the National Assembly a laughing stock, widely reported in the press, with politicians' erratic behaviour reinforcing the belief abroad that they were incapable of governing. The judicial administration is corrupt, roads and bridges are crumbling. In the absence of an effective police force, larger and larger groups of people are forming around the country, ostensibly for self-defence but in practice for raids, often on Turkish villages, and the prince is forced to send the war minister, Hernroth, to restore order. The limited rights given to the prince by the constitution did not enable him to exert much influence. Earlier attempts to do something about it met with the firm resistance of Emperor Alexander II. After the assassination of the Russian Emperor on 1 March 1881, Battenberg went to his funeral, where he persuaded the new Russian Emperor Alexander III to support him. As a result, the Russian government began to consider the possibility of changing Bulgaria's form of government and possibly introducing an absolute monarchy, but eventually ruled in favour of suspending the Tarnovo Constitution, but by convening a Grand National Assembly. The prince also received consent for action in this direction from the Russian allies Germany and Austria-Hungary."

 eoanb_bulgaria.29.t: "Second Grand National Assembly"
 eoanb_bulgaria.29.d: "307 Members of the National Assembly are present. The former Exarch Antim I was elected President. With an absolute majority of the Conservative Party, the monarch is given the power to rule alone by decree for 7 years by acclamation and without a vote, and to convene the Grand National Assembly to change the Tarnovo Constitution within that period. The whole country is divided into five districts, which are governed by "proconsular commissioners". The proconsuls are Russian officers who are not known for their understanding and respect for the democratic process. "
