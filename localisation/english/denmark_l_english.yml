### FOCUSES/FOCI ###
#Economy/Industry
DEN_focus_danish_economy:0 "Danish Economy"
DEN_focus_danish_economy_desc:0 "Denmark is still a largely agrarian nation, with much of our economy relying on farming. However, if this status quo is allowed to continue our nation will fall behind its neighbors, as well as carrying the risk that if significant changes in the prices of food occur our economy could collapse. To provide our people with the goods, opportunities, and security they require we must begin further industrialization."
DEN_focus_abolition_of_the_sound_toll:0 "The Abolition of the Sound Toll"
DEN_focus_abolition_of_the_sound_toll_desc:0 "The Sound Toll had been an essential part of our government income for centuries, but its effect on our economy was proven to be quite negative. We must bear the weight of this loss in order to improve the strength of our economy and improve our relations with our neighbors and trade partners. With the reasonable compensation we have received for the abolition, we should immediately invest those funds into other projects."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_projects:0 "Infrastructure Projects"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_projects_desc:0 "In order to utilize our industrial buildup in ways which will benefit our citizens, we will modernize our infrastructure. These improvements will allow faster communication, better trade, and increase the ease of travel for goods and people across the nation. Once these improvements have been made, we could even begin work on even more modern initiatives to supplement what we have already constructed."
DEN_focus_aarhus_randers_railway:0 "The Aarhus-Randers Railway Line"
DEN_focus_aarhus_randers_railway_desc:0 "Randers is one of the most prominent cities of Jutland, and is one of the most important centers for the agricultural industry. Aarhus on the other hand has long been a major center for industrial processing of agricultural products, as well as a major trade center. By connecting the two cities we can unite the region closer together, as well as significantly bolstering the economies of both cities."
DEN_focus_fredericia_aarhus_railway:0 "The Fredericia-Aarhus Railway Line"
DEN_focus_fredericia_aarhus_railway_desc:0 "Fredericia has two roles: it acts as a port and as a center for the production of innovative goods and other industries. Due to this, connecting it to the economic powerhouse of Aarhus, which has its own ports and industries, would allow a greater interconnectedness between both of their economies, as well as providing a corridor further south in the kingdom. With this effort we can connect the nation, its goods, and our people."
DEN_focus_lille_syd_railway:0 "The Lille Syd Railway Line"
DEN_focus_lille_syd_railway_desc:0 "While our rail line from Copenhagen to Korsør was completed years ago, further rail lines could help further improve the economy of Zealand. With an additional line that connects to our already constructed rail, we can connect previously neglected areas of Zealand, helping to improve the lives of those living away from the capital and the strength of Copenhagen's position."
DEN_focus_odense_svendborg_railway:0 "The Odense-Svendborg Railway Line"
DEN_focus_odense_svendborg_railway_desc:0 "Odense has found itself as the second largest city of Denmark, and dominates its island of Funen. By connecting Odense to Svendborg in the south we can promote the economy of both cities, as well as helping to interconnect our nation to a greater extent. This effort would solidify the place of Odense, and hopefully improve the lives of people across both the island and our nation."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_bornholm:0 "Improve Infrastructure on Bornholm"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_bornholm_desc:0 "Bornholm is somewhat isolated compared to the rest of Denmark, and while bridges between other islands could be considered, Bornholm can never be connected directly to Zealand. Therefore, to improve the situation for our citizens on Bornholm we must make investments into their local infrastructure with a focus on the development of the region itself, rather than its interconnectedness."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_iceland:0 "Improve Infrastructure on Iceland"
DEN_focus_infrastructure_iceland_desc:0 "Iceland is distant from our main islands, but has strategic importance and provides useful resources as well as a strong fishing industry. Additional improvements to its infrastructure. These efforts could potentially strengthen the already present economy of the island, and give local and national investors the opportunity for further investment and development of the island."
DEN_focus_infrastructure_faroe_islands:0 "Improve Infrastructure on the Faroe Islands"

The exact allocation of the budget will depend on the ideals, goals, and needs of our generals and war ministry, but it should significantly improve their position.

To face this fact, we will research and develop more advanced engines that can be refitted onto our own ships, and also improve newly constructed ships as they are constructed. Proper refitting of our ships, and the development of more modern engines will also make it easier for us to keep up with such advances in the future, as the foundation is built for succeeding generations of improvement."

If all goes as planned, we will also be able to rely on assistance from other nations, and possibly even have our allies join the war.

#Country Leader Descriptions
DEN_CARL_CHRISTOFFER_GEORG_ANDRAE_LEADER_DESC:0 "Carl Christopher Georg Andræ is the President of Denmark and the leader of the Cabinet of Andræ. From 1842 until 1854, he was a professor of mathematics and mechanics at the national military college. During his tenure as professor, he was royally appointed as a member of the 1848 Danish Constituent Assembly, and six years later, became Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Bang. He was appointed President of Denmark in 1856 but although he was trying to appease both the left and the right, his reign unfortunately hasn't been one of peace and calm, as tensions continue to rise in Schleswig and Holstein even after the conclusion of the First Schleswig War. Due to the tiring political turf war, his days as president seem numbered, and it has become semi-public knowledge within political circles that Andræ is considering retirement from his position."
DEN_CARL_CHRISTIAN_HALL_LEADER_DESC:0 "Carl Christian Hall is a Danish national liberal statesman. He had a distinguished tenure at school and college, after which he became a professor of law. His first steps in politics was when Hall had taken office in the Bang administration on the 12th of December 1854. He's since grown quite a reputation as a politician and, as of now, he has been appointed President of Denmark. With rising tensions around the Schleswig-Holstein question, Hall has been a strong supporter of the Ejderpolitikken policy, which aims to restore Denmark's historic southern border on the Eider river, which runs between Schleswig and Holstein. Hall shares this belief with most of the national liberals, who aim to tie the Duchy of Schleswig more firmly to Denmark, even if it means confrontation with the German Confederation."
DEN_CHRISTIAN_EMIL_FRIJS_LEADER_DESC:0 "Christian Emil Frijs is a Danish politician that is currently the President of Denmark, heading the Frijs Cabinet. He graduated from Sorø Academy in 1835, going on to study law. He is the wealthiest large squire of Denmark and is honored by his peasants. He is part of the Højre, also known as the Conservative Party and is actively against the National Liberals. Noticing the tensions around Schleswig-Holstein, Frijs so far has decided to oppose the Ejderpolitikken policy in favor of maintaining the status-quo."

The German population in Schleswig-Holstein is also interesting for the German Confederation, in which various factions want to integrate those German-speaking parts into it, again, leading to conflict with Denmark, which also has claims on our region. This complicated situation means that tensions between the Germans and Denmark are tense and could escalate any second..."

Only time may tell if Denmark is willing to follow the regulations set by the London Protocol or if they will want to pursue the path of integrating Schleswig into Denmark..."
