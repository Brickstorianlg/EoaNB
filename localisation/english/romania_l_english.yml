 rom_wallachia.1.d: "As expected the strategical position of Wallachia on the Balakans, brought on the Russian fury during the Crimean War of 1856 which devistated the already fledging agriculture based economy of the state. In 1857, Wallachia now stand on a continental crossroad, between -The Russian Empire, The Austrian Empire and The Ottoman Empire. Wallachia's ambition to unite the romanian people, long divided since the dawn of the 15th centry, is greatly hindered by it's overlord -The Ottoman Empire, always trying to strenghten it's grip on it's balkan holdings, however one by one, they're all slipping away. If Wallachia ever wishes to unite the state of Romania it will have to lick it's wounds and prepare itself and it's people for hopefully the upcoming elections, which shall decide if the divide between the people of Romania shall finally be mended..."

A direct successor of the "Pruncul Roman" newspaper, this newspaper promotes the radical takeover of Wallachia and Moldavia in order to unify the two principalities. The newspaper has direct connection with the radical ideology in Western Europe, it would be advised to crack down on them to avoid more problem as leaving them unchecked would mean possible increased revolutionary activity."

A great economist and diplomat, his economic skill will be of great help to our cause and help the United  Principalities to industrialize further while his diplomatic skill might help in getting the Great Powers to support our independence from the Ottoman Empire or atract foreign investors.
